And I perhaps am secret; Heavâ€™n is high,  
High and remote to see from thence distinct  
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps  
May have diverted from continual watch  
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies  
About him. But to _Adam_ in what sort  
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known  
As yet my change, and give him to partake  
Full happiness with mee, or rather not,  
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power  
Without Copartner? so to add what wants  
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,  
And render me more equal, and perhaps  
A thing not undesireable, somtime  
Superior; for inferior who is free?  
This may be well: but what if God have seen,  
And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, </pre></div> </div>
