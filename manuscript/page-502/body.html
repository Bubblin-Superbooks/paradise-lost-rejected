Before my Judge, either to undergoe  
My self the total Crime, or to accuse  
My other self, the partner of my life;  
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,  
I should conceal, and not expose to blame  
By my complaint; but strict necessitie  
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,  
Least on my head both sin and punishment,  
However insupportable, be all  
Devolv’d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou  
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.  
This Woman whom thou mad’st to be my help,  
And gav’st me as thy perfet gift, so good,  
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,  
That from her hand I could suspect no ill,  
And what she did, whatever in it self,  
Her doing seem’d to justifie the deed; </pre></div> </div>
