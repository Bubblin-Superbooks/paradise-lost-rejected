Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,  
But opposite in leveld West was set  
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light  
From him, for other light she needed none  
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes  
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,  
Revolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign  
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,  
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d  
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd  
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,  
Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day.  

And God said, let the Waters generate  
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:  
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings  
Displayd on the op’n Firmament of Heav’n. </pre></div> </div>
