With faultring speech and visage incompos’d  
Answer’d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art,  
That mighty leading Angel, who of late  
Made head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown.  
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host  
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep  
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,  
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates  
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands  
Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here  
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,  
That little which is left so to defend  
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles  
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell  
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;  
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World  
Hung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain </pre></div> </div>
