Seek not the praise of men: the other sort  
In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,  
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome  
Canceld from Heav’n and sacred memorie,  
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.  
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,  
Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise  
And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires  
Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:  
Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.  

And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv’d,  
With many an inrode gor’d; deformed rout  
Enter’d, and foul disorder; all the ground  
With shiverd armour strow’n, and on a heap  
Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd  
And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld </pre></div> </div>
