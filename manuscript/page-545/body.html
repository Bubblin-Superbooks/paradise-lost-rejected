Not to do onely, but to will the same  
With me? how can they acquitted stand  
In sight of God? Him after all Disputes  
Forc’t I absolve: all my evasions vain  
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still  
But to my own conviction: first and last

Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;

That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,  
Then all the world much heavier, though divided  
With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir’st,  
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope  
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable  
Beyond all past example and future,  
To _Satan_ onely like both crime and doom.  
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears </pre></div> </div>
