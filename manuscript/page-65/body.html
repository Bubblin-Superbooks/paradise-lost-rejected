With Armed watch, that render all access  
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep  
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing  
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,  
Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way  
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise  
With blackest Insurrection, to confound  
Heav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie  
All incorruptible would on his Throne  
Sit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould  
Incapable of stain would soon expel  
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire  
Victorious. Thus repuls’d, our final hope  
Is flat despair: we must exasperate  
Th’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,  
And that must end us, that must be our cure,  
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, </pre></div> </div>
