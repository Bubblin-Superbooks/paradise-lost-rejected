Fanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek  
Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms  
Rather then human. Nor did _Israel_ scape  
Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d  
The Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King  
Doubl’d that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_,  
Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,  
_Jehovah_, who in one Night when he pass’d  
From _Egypt_ marching, equal’d with one stroke  
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.  
_Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd  
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love  
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood  
Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee  
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest  
Turns Atheist, as did _Ely’s_ Sons, who fill’d  
With lust and violence the house of God. </pre></div> </div>
