Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,  
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then  
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild  
Of all our good, sham’d, naked, miserable.  
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve  
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek  
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.  

To whom soon mov’d with touch of blame thus _Eve_.  
What words have past thy Lips, _Adam_ severe,  
Imput’st thou that to my default, or will  
Of wandering, as thou call’st it, which who knows  
But might as ill have happ’nd thou being by,  
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,  
Or bere th’ attempt, thou couldst not have discernd  
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; </pre></div> </div>
