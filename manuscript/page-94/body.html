The lip of _Tantalus_. Thus roving on  
In confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands  
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast  
View’d first thir lamentable lot, and found  
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile  
They pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,  
O’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,  
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,  
A Universe of death, which God by curse  
Created evil, for evil only good,  
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,  
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,  
Abominable, inutterable, and worse  
Then Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,  
_Gorgons_ and _Hydra’s_, and _Chimera’s_ dire. </pre></div> </div>
