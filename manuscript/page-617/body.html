As present, Heav’nly instructer, I revive  
At this last sight, assur’d that Man shall live  
With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.  
Farr less I now lament for one whole World  
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce  
For one Man found so perfet and so just,  
That God voutsafes to raise another World  
From him, and all his anger to forget.  
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,  
Distended as the Brow of God appeas’d,  
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde  
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,  
Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?  

To whom th’ Archangel. Dextrously thou aim’st;  
So willingly doth God remit his Ire,  
Though late repenting him of Man deprav’d, </pre></div> </div>
