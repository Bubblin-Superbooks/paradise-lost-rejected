Shall tremble, he descending, will himself  
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound  
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine  
To civil Justice, part religious Rites  
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types  
And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise  
The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve  
Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God  
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech  
That _Moses_ might report to them his will,  
And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,  
Instructed that to God is no access  
Without Mediator, whose high Office now  
_Moses_ in figure beares, to introduce  
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,  
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times  
Of great _Messiah_ shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites </pre></div> </div>
