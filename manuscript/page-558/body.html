Resolv’d, as thou proposest; so our Foe  
Shall scape his punishment ordain’d, and wee  
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.  
No more be mention’d then of violence  
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,  
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely  
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,  
Reluctance against God and his just yoke  
Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild  
And gracious temper he both heard and judg’d  
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected  
Immediate dissolution, which we thought  
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee  
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,  
And bringing forth, soon recompenc’t with joy,  
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope  
Glanc’d on the ground, with labour I must earne </pre></div> </div>
