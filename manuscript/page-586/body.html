As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.  

To whom thus _Adam_ gratefully repli’d.  
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path  
Thou lead’st me, and to the hand of Heav’n submit,  
However chast’ning, to the evil turne  
My obvious breast, arming to overcom  
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,  
If so I may attain. So both ascend  
In the Visions of God: It was a Hill  
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top  
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken  
Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.  
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,  
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set  
Our second _Adam_ in the Wilderness,  
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. </pre></div> </div>
