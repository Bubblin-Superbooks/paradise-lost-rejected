Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,  
Half spi’d, so thick the Roses bushing round  
About her glowd, oft stooping to support  
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay  
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,  
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies  
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,  
Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,  
From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.  
Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers’d  
Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,  
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen  
Among thick-wov’n Arborets and Flours  
Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of _Eve_:  
Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign’d  
Or of reviv’d _Adonis_, or renownd  
_Alcinous_, host of old _Laertes_ Son, </pre></div> </div>
