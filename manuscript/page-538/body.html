Daughter of Sin, among th’ irrational,  
Death introduc’d through fierce antipathie:  
Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,  
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,  
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe  
Of Man, but fled him, or with count’nance grim  
Glar’d on him passing: these were from without  
The growing miseries, which _Adam_ saw  
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,  
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,  
And in a troubl’d Sea of passion tost,  
Thus to disburd’n sought with sad complaint.  

O miserable of happie! is this the end  
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late  
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom  
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face </pre></div> </div>
