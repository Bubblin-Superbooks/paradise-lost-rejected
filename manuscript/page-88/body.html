A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d  
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.  
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry  
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:  
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim  
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie  
By Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss  
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell  
With deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim.  
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d  
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers  
Disband, and wandring, each his several way  
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice  
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find  
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain  
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.  
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime </pre></div> </div>
