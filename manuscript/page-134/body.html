Mans mortal crime, and just th’ unjust to save,  
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?  

He ask’d, but all the Heav’nly Quire stood mute,  
And silence was in Heav’n: on mans behalf  
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,  
Much less that durst upon his own head draw  
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.  
And now without redemption all mankind  
Must have bin lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell  
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,  
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,  
His dearest mediation thus renewd.  

Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;  
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,  
The speediest of thy winged messengers, </pre></div> </div>
