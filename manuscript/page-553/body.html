Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv’n,  
To me committed and by me expos’d.  
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame  
Each other, blam’d enough elsewhere, but strive  
In offices of Love, how we may light’n  
Each others burden in our share of woe;  
Since this days Death denounc’t, if ought I see,  
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac’t evill,  
A long days dying to augment our paine,  
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv’d.  

To whom thus _Eve_, recovering heart, repli’d.  
_Adam_, by sad experiment I know  
How little weight my words with thee can finde,  
Found so erroneous, thence by just event  
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,  
Restor’d by thee, vile as I am, to place </pre></div> </div>
