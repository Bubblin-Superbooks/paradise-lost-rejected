To whom thus also th’ Angel last repli’d:  
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe  
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs  
Thou knewst by name, and all th’ ethereal Powers,  
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,  
Or works of God in Heav’n, Air, Earth, or Sea,  
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,  
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add  
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,  
Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,  
By name to come call’d Charitie, the soul  
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath  
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess  
A Paradise within thee, happier farr.  
Let us descend now therefore from this top  
Of Speculation; for the hour precise </pre></div> </div>
