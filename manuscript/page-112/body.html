Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere,  
Hee rules a moment; _Chaos_ Umpire sits,  
And by decision more imbroiles the fray  
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter  
_Chance_ governs all. Into this wilde Abyss,  
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,  
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,

Unless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain  
His dark materials to create more Worlds,  
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend  
Stood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while,  
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith  
He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal’d  
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare  
Great things with small) then when _Bellona_ storms, </pre></div> </div>
