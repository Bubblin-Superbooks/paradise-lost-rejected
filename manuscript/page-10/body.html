Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.  
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer  
Before all Temples th’ upright heart and pure,  
Instruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first  
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread  
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss  
And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark  
Illumine, what is low raise and support;  
That to the highth of this great Argument  
I may assert th’ Eternal Providence,  
And justifie the wayes of God to men.  

Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view  
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause  
Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,  
Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off  
From their Creator, and transgress his Will </pre></div> </div>
