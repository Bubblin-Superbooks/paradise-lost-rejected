That day I oft remember, when from sleep  
I first awak’t, and found my self repos’d  
Under a shade on flours, much wondring where  
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.  
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound  
Of waters issu’d from a Cave and spread  
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov’d  
Pure as th’ expanse of Heav’n; I thither went  
With unexperienc’t thought, and laid me downe  
On the green bank, to look into the cleer  
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.  
As I bent down to look, just opposite,  
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd  
Bending to look on me, I started back,  
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,  
Pleas’d it returnd as soon with answering looks  
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt </pre></div> </div>
