Wandring this darksome desart, as my way  
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,  
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek  
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds  
Confine with Heav’n; or if som other place  
From your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King  
Possesses lately, thither to arrive  
I travel this profound, direct my course;  
Directed, no mean recompence it brings  
To your behoof, if I that Region lost,  
All usurpation thence expell’d, reduce  
To her original darkness and your sway  
(Which is my present journey) and once more  
Erect the Standerd there of _Ancient Night_;  
Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.  

Thus _Satan_; and him thus the Anarch old </pre></div> </div>
