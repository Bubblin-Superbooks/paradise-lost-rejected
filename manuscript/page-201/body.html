See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass  
The vigilance here plac’t, but such as come  
Well known from Heav’n; and since Meridian hour  
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,  
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds  
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude  
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.  
But if within the circuit of these walks  
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom  
Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.  

So promis’d hee, and _Uriel_ to his charge  
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd  
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall’n  
Beneath th’ _Azores_; whither the prime Orb,  
Incredible how swift, had thither rowl’d  
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth </pre></div> </div>
