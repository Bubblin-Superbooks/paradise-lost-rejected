And Valour and Heroic Vertu call’d;  
To overcome in Battel, and subdue  
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite  
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch  
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done  
Of triumph, to be styl’d great Conquerours,  
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,  
Destroyers rightlier call’d and Plagues of men.  
Thus Fame shall be achiev’d, renown on Earth,  
And what most merits fame in silence hid.  
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst  
The onely righteous in a World perverse,  
And therefore hated, therefore so beset  
With Foes for daring single to be just,  
And utter odious Truth, that God would come  
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High  
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds </pre></div> </div>
