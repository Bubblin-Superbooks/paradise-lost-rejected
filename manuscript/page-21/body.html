As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,  
_Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warr’d on _Jove_,  
_Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den  
By ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast  
_Leviathan_, which God of all his works  
Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:  
Him haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam  
The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,  
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,  
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind  
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night  
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:  
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay  
Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence  
Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will  
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven  
Left him at large to his own dark designs, </pre></div> </div>
