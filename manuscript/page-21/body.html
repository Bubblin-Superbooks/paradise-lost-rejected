Leader of those Armies bright,Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledgeOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oftIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edgeOf battel when it rag’d, in all assaultsTheir surest signal, they will soon resumeNew courage and revive, though now they lyeGroveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.</p></div> </div>
