He ended, and his words replete with guile  
Into her heart too easie entrance won:  
Fixt on the Fruit she gaz’d, which to behold  
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound  
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn’d  
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;  
Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak’d  
An eager appetite, rais’d by the smell  
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,  
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,  
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first  
Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus’d.  

Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,  
Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir’d, </pre></div> </div>
