His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:  
This to attain, whether Heav’n move or Earth,  
Imports not, if thou reck’n right, the rest  
From Man or Angel the great Architect  
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge  
His secrets to be scann’d by them who ought  
Rather admire; or if they list to try  
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav’ns  
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move  
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide  
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav’n  
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild  
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive  
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear  
With Centric and Eccentric scribl’d o’re,  
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:  
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, </pre></div> </div>
