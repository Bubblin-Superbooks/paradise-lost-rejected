Into th’ _Euboic_ Sea. Others more milde,  
Retreated in a silent valley, sing

In thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high  
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,  
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,  
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.  
Of good and evil much they argu’d then, </pre></div> </div>
