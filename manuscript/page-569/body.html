Forever, to remove him I decree,  
And send him from the Garden forth to Till  
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.  

_Michael_, this my behest have thou in charge,  
Take to thee from among the Cherubim  
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend  
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade  
Vacant possession som new trouble raise:  
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God  
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,  
From hallowd ground th’ unholie, and denounce  
To them and to thir Progenie from thence  
Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint  
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg’d,  
For I behold them soft’nd and with tears  
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. </pre></div> </div>
