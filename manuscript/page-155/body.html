Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon  
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,  
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,  
Like those _Hesperian_ Gardens fam’d of old,  
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,  
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there  
He stayd not to enquire: above them all  
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven  
Allur’d his eye: Thither his course he bends  
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe  
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,  
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie  
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,  
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,  
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move  
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute  
Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp</pre></div> </div>
