As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav’n  
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange  
And hear the din; thus was the building left  
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam’d.  

Whereto thus _Adam_ fatherly displeas’d.  
O execrable Son so to aspire  
Above his Brethren, to himself affirming  
Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv’n:  
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl  
Dominion absolute; that right we hold  
By his donation; but Man over men  
He made not Lord; such title to himself  
Reserving, human left from human free.  
But this Usurper his encroachment proud  
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends  
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food </pre></div> </div>
