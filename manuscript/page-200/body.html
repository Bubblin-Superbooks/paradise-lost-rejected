No evil thing approach or enter in;  
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare  
A Spirit, zealous, as he seem’d, to know  
More of th’ Almighties works, and chiefly Man  
Gods latest Image: I describ’d his way  
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;  
But in the Mount that lies from _Eden_ North,  
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks  
Alien from Heav’n, with passions foul obscur’d:  
Mine eye pursu’d him still, but under shade  
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew  
I fear, hath ventur’d from the deep, to raise  
New troubles; him thy care must be to find.  

To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:  
_Uriel_, no wonder if thy perfet sight,  
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, </pre></div> </div>
