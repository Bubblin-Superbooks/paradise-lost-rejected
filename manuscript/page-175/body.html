Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:  
On which the Sun more glad impress’d his beams  
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,  
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd  
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire  
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires  
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive  
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales  
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense  
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole  
Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile  
Beyond the _Cape of Hope_, and now are past  
_Mozambic_, off at Sea North-East windes blow  
_Sabean_ Odours from the spicie shoare  
Of _Arabie_ the blest, with such delay  
Well pleas’d they slack thir course, and many a League  
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. </pre></div> </div>
