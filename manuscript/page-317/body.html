With silent circumspection unespi’d.  
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav’n appeerd  
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms  
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood  
Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,  
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills  
Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,  
Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,  
Where lodg’d, or whither fled, or if for fight,  
In motion or in alt: him soon they met  
Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow  
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail  
_Zephiel_, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,  
Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri’d.  

Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, </pre></div> </div>
