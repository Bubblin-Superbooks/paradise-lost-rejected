Your fill what happiness this happie state  
Can comprehend, incapable of more.  

To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli’d.  
O favourable spirit, propitious guest,  
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct  
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set  
From center to circumference, whereon  
In contemplation of created things  
By steps we may ascend to God. But say,  
What meant that caution joind, _If ye be found  
obedient?_ can wee want obedience then  
To him, or possibly his love desert  
Who formd us from the dust, and plac’d us here  
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss  
Human desires can seek or apprehend? </pre></div> </div>
