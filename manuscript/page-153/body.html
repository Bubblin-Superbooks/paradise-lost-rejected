Over the _Promis’d Land_ to God so dear,  
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,  
On high behests his Angels to and fro  
Pass’d frequent, and his eye with choice regard  
From _Paneas_ the fount of _Jordans_ flood  
To _Beersaba_, where the _Holy Land_  
Borders on _Aegypt_ and the _Arabian_ shoare;  
So wide the op’ning seemd, where bounds were set  
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.  
_Satan_ from hence now on the lower stair  
That scal’d by steps of Gold to Heav’n Gate  
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view  
Of all this World at once. As when a Scout  
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone  
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne  
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,  
Which to his eye discovers unaware </pre></div> </div>
