This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods  
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,  
Since through experience of this great event  
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,  
We may with more successful hope resolve  
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr  
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,  
Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy  
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.  

So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,  
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:  
And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.  

O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,  
That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr  
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds </pre></div> </div>
