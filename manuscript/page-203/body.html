Of night, and all things now retir’d to rest  
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set  
Labour and rest, as day and night to men  
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep  
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines  
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long  
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;  
Man hath his daily work of body or mind  
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,  
And the regard of Heav’n on all his waies;  
While other Animals unactive range,  
And of thir doings God takes no account.  
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East  
With first approach of light, we must be ris’n,  
And at our pleasant labour, to reform  
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,  
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown, </pre></div> </div>
