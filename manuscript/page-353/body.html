Immense, and all his Father in him shon.  
About his Chariot numberless were pour’d  
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,  
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing’d,

Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound  
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth  
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word  
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.  
On heav’nly ground they stood, and from the shore  
They view’d the vast immeasurable Abyss  
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, </pre></div> </div>
