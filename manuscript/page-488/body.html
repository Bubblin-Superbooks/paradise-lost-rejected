Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground  
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow  
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade  
High overarch’t, and echoing Walks between;  
There oft the _Indian_ Herdsman shunning heate  
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds  
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves  
They gatherd, broad as _Amazonian_ Targe,  
And with what skill they had, together sowd,  
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide  
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike  
To that first naked Glorie. Such of late  
_Columbus_ found th’ _American_ to girt  
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde  
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.  
Thus fenc’t, and as they thought, thir shame in part </pre></div> </div>
