Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise  
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronouncâ€™t or sung  
Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence  
Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,  
More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp  
To add more sweetness, and they thus began.  

These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,  
Almightie, thine this universal Frame,  
Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!  
Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens  
To us invisible or dimly seen  
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare  
Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:  
Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,  
Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs  
And choral symphonies, Day without Night, </pre></div> </div>
