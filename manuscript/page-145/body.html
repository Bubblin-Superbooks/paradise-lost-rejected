Thou drov’st of warring Angels disarraid.  
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime  
Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,  
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,  
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall’n,  
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome  
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:  
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son  
Perceive thee purpos’d not to doom frail Man  
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin’d,  
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife  
Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern’d,  
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat  
Second to thee, offerd himself to die  
For mans offence. O unexampl’d love,  
Love no where to be found less then Divine!  
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name </pre></div> </div>
