To judge th’ unfaithful dead, but to reward  
His faithful, and receave them into bliss,  
Whether in Heav’n or Earth, for then the Earth  
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place  
Then this of _Eden_, and far happier daies.  

So spake th’ Archangel _Michael_, then paus’d,  
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire  
Replete with joy and wonder thus repli’d.  

O goodness infinite, goodness immense!  
That all this good of evil shall produce,  
And evil turn to good; more wonderful  
Then that which by creation first brought forth  
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,  
Whether I should repent me now of sin  
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce </pre></div> </div>
