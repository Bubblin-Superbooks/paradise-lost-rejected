Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.  
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,  
VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades  
To answer, and resound farr other Song.  
VVhom thus afflicted when sad _Eve_ beheld,  
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,  
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay’d:  
But her with stern regard he thus repell’d.  

Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best  
Befits thee with him leagu’d, thy self as false  
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,  
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew  
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee  
Henceforth; least that too heav’nly form, pretended  
To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee  
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride </pre></div> </div>
