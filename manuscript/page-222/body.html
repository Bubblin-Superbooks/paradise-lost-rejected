Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,  
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain  
Can equal anger infinite provok’t.  
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee  
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them  
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they  
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,  
The first in flight from pain, had’st thou alleg’d  
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,  
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.  

To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.  
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,  
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood  
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide  
The blasting volied Thunder made all speed  
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. </pre></div> </div>
