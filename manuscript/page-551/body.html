Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,  
As joyn’d in injuries, one enmitie  
Against a Foe by doom express assign’d us,  
That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not  
Thy hatred for this miserie befall’n,  
On me already lost, mee then thy self  
More miserable; both have sin’d, but thou  
Against God onely, I against God and thee,  
And to the place of judgement will return,  
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all  
The sentence from thy head remov’d may light  
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,  
Mee mee onely just object of his ire.  

She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,  
Immoveable till peace obtain’d from fault  
Acknowledg’d and deplor’d, in _Adam_ wraught </pre></div> </div>
