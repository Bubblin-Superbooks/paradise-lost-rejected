But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,  
Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,  
To _Pales_, or _Pomona_, thus adornd,  
Likest she seemd, _Pomona_ when she fled  
_Vertumnus_, or to _Ceres_ in her Prime,  
Yet Virgin of _Proserpina_ from _Jove_.  
Her long with ardent look his _Eye_ pursu’d  
Delighted, but desiring more her stay.  
Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,  
Repeated, shee to him as oft engag’d  
To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,  
And all things in best order to invite  
Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.  
O much deceav’d, much failing, hapless _Eve_,  
Of thy presum’d return! event perverse!  
Thou never from that houre in Paradise  
Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; </pre></div> </div>
