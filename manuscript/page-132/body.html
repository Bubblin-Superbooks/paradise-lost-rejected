His fall’n condition is, and to me ow  
All his deliv’rance, and to none but me.  
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace  
Elect above the rest; so is my will:  
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd  
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes  
Th’ incensed Deitie, while offerd grace  
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,  
What may suffice, and soft’n stonie hearts  
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.  
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,  
Though but endevord with sincere intent,  
Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.  
And I will place within them as a guide  
My Umpire _Conscience_, whom if they will hear,  
Light after light well us’d they shall attain,  
And to the end persisting, safe arrive. </pre></div> </div>
