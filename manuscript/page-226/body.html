While thus he spake, th’ Angelic Squadron bright  
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes  
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round  
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field  
Of _Ceres_ ripe for harvest waving bends  
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind  
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands  
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves  
Prove chaff. On th’ other side _Satan_ allarm’d  
Collecting all his might dilated stood,  
Like _Teneriff_ or _Atlas_ unremov’d:  
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest  
Sat horror Plum’d; nor wanted in his graspe  
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds  
Might have ensu’d, nor onely Paradise </pre></div> </div>
