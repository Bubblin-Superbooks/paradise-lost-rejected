Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host  
Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris’d,  
Then first with fear surpris’d and sense of paine  
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought  
By sinne of disobedience, till that hour  
Not liable to fear or flight or paine.  
Far otherwise th’ inviolable Saints  
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc’t entire,  
Invulnerable, impenitrably arm’d:  
Such high advantages thir innocence  
Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,  
Not to have disobei’d; in fight they stood  
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain’d  
By wound, though from thir place by violence mov’d.  

Now Night her course began, and over Heav’n  
Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos’d, </pre></div> </div>
