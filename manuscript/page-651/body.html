Of him so lately promis’d to thy aid,  
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,  
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,  
Last in the Clouds from Heav’n to be reveald  
In glory of the Father, to dissolve  
_Satan_ with his perverted World, then raise  
From the conflagrant mass, purg’d and refin’d,  
New Heav’ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date  
Founded in righteousness and peace and love,  
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.  

He ended; and thus _Adam_ last reply’d.  
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,  
Measur’d this transient World, the Race of time,  
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,  
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.  
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, </pre></div> </div>
