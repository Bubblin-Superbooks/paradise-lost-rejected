Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,  
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,  
Or som more sudden vengeance wing’d from God  
Precipitate thee with augmented paine.  

So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus  
The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind  
Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds  
Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these  
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise  
Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee  
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats  
To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end  
The strife which thou call’st evil, but wee style  
The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,  
Or turn this Heav’n it self into the Hell  
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, </pre></div> </div>
