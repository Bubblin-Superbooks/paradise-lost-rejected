His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent  
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart  
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side  
Henceforth an individual solace dear;  
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim  
My other half: with that thy gentle hand  
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see  
How beauty is excelld by manly grace  
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.  

So spake our general Mother, and with eyes  
Of conjugal attraction unreprovâ€™d,  
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand  
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast  
Naked met his under the flowing Gold  
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight  
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms </pre></div> </div>
