Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms  
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.  
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power  
Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac’d)  
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills  
(For Earth hath this variety from Heav’n  
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)

From thir foundations loosning to and fro  
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,  
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops  
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,  
Be sure, and terrour seis’d the rebel Host,  
When coming towards them so dread they saw  
The bottom of the Mountains upward turn’d,  
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row  
They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence </pre></div> </div>
