At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head  
And shape Starr bright appeer’d, or brighter, clad  
With what permissive glory since his fall  
Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz’d  
At that so sudden blaze the _Stygian_ throng  
Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish’d beheld,  
Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th’ acclaime:  
Forth rush’d in haste the great consulting Peers,  
Rais’d from thir dark _Divan_, and with like joy  
Congratulant approach’d him, who with hand  
Silence, and with these words attention won.  

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,  
For in possession such, not onely of right,  
I call ye and declare ye now, returnd  
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth  
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit </pre></div> </div>
