Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise  
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,  
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires  
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.  
Him thus intent _Ithuriel_ with his Spear  
Touch’d lightly; for no falshood can endure  
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns  
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts  
Discoverd and surpriz’d. As when a spark  
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid  
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store  
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine  
With sudden blaze diffus’d, inflames the Aire:  
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.  
Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz’d  
So sudden to behold the grieslie King;  
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. </pre></div> </div>
