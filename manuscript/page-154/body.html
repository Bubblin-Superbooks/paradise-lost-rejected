The goodly prospect of some forein land  
First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis  
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,  
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.  
Such wonder seis’d, though after Heaven seen,  
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis’d  
At sight of all this World beheld so faire.  
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood  
So high above the circling Canopie  
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point  
Of _Libra_ to the fleecie Starr that bears  
_Andromeda_ farr off _Atlantick_ Seas  
Beyond th’ _Horizon_; then from Pole to Pole  
He views in bredth, and without longer pause  
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws  
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease  
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way </pre></div> </div>
