Before his memorie, as one whose drouth  
Yet scarce allay’d still eyes the current streame,  
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,  
Proceeded thus to ask his Heav’nly Guest.  

Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,  
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d  
Divine Interpreter, by favour sent  
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne  
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,  
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:  
For which to the infinitly Good we owe  
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment  
Receave with solemne purpose to observe  
Immutably his sovran will, the end  
Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf’t  
Gently for our instruction to impart </pre></div> </div>
