(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part  
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found  
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure  
Intelligential substances require  
As doth your Rational; and both contain  
Within them every lower facultie  
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,  
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,  
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.  
For know, whatever was created, needs  
To be sustaind and fed; of Elements  
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,  
Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires  
Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;  
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurgâ€™d  
Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.  
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale </pre></div> </div>
