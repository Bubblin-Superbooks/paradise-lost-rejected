And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food  
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th’ Earth yeelds,  
Varietie without end; but of the Tree  
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,  
Thou mai’st not; in the day thou eat’st, thou di’st;  
Death is the penaltie impos’d, beware,  
And govern well thy appetite, least sin  
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.  
Here finish’d hee, and all that he had made  
View’d, and behold all was entirely good;  
So Ev’n and Morn accomplish’d the Sixt day:  
Yet not till the Creator from his work  
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd  
Up to the Heav’n of Heav’ns his high abode,  
Thence to behold this new created World  
Th’ addition of his Empire, how it shew’d  
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, </pre></div> </div>
