Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land  
He comes invited by a yonger Son  
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds  
Raise him to be the second in that Realme  
Of _Pharao_: there he dies, and leaves his Race  
Growing into a Nation, and now grown  
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks  
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests  
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves  
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:  
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call  
_Moses_ and _Aaron_) sent from God to claime  
His people from enthralment, they return  
With glory and spoile back to thir promisâ€™d Land.  
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies  
To know thir God, or message to regard,  
Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire; </pre></div> </div>
