Before thir eyes in sudden view appear  
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark  
Illimitable Ocean without bound,  
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,  
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night  
And _Chaos_, Ancestors of Nature, hold

Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,  
Light-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,  
Swarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands  
Of _Barca_ or _Cyrene’s_ torrid soil,  
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise </pre></div> </div>
