The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,  
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,  
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine  
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n  
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.  
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use  
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,  
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,  
And set them in the Firmament of Heav’n  
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day  
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,  
And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw,  
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:  
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun  
A mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,  
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon  
Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, </pre></div> </div>
