Shall be the copious matter of my Song  
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise  
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.  

Thus they in Heav’n, above the starry Sphear,  
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.  
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe  
Of this round World, whose first convex divides  
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos’d  
From _Chaos_ and th’ inroad of Darkness old,  
_Satan_ alighted walks: a Globe farr off  
It seem’d, now seems a boundless Continent  
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night  
Starless expos’d, and ever-threatning storms  
Of _Chaos_ blustring round, inclement skie;  
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav’n  
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines </pre></div> </div>
