Man is to live, and all things live for Man.  

To whom thus _Eve_ with sad demeanour meek.  
Ill worthie I such title should belong  
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind  
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach  
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:  
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,  
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac’t  
The sourse of life; next favourable thou,  
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf’t,  
Farr other name deserving. But the Field  
To labour calls us now with sweat impos’d,  
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,  
All unconcern’d with our unrest, begins  
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,  
I never from thy side henceforth to stray, </pre></div> </div>
