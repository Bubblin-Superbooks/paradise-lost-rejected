Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,  
Under amazement of their hideous change.  
He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep  
Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,  
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,  
If such astonishment as this can sieze  
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place  
After the toyl of Battel to repose  
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find  
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?  
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn  
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds  
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood  
With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon  
His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern  
Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down  
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts </pre></div> </div>
