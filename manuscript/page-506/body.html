Captivity led captive through the Aire,  
The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,  
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;  
Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,  
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn’d.

By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring  
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will  
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.

And eaten of the Tree concerning which  
I charg’d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,  
Curs’d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow </pre></div> </div>
