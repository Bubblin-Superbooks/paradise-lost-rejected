To whom the Angel. Son of Heav’n and Earth,  
Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;  
That thou continu’st such, owe to thy self,  
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.  
This was that caution giv’n thee; be advis’d.  
God made thee perfet, not immutable;  
And good he made thee, but to persevere  
He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will  
By nature free, not over-rul’d by Fate  
Inextricable, or strict necessity;  
Our voluntarie service he requires,  
Not our necessitated, such with him  
Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how  
Can hearts, not free, be tri’d whether they serve  
Willing or no, who will but what they must  
By Destinie, and can no other choose? </pre></div> </div>
