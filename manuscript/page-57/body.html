Outshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_,  
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand  
Showrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl & Gold,  
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais’d  
To that bad eminence; and from despair  
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires  
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue  
Vain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught  
His proud imaginations thus displaid.  

Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,  
For since no deep within her gulf can hold  
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,  
I give not Heav’n for lost. From this descent </pre></div> </div>
