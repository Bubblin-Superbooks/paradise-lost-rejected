Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.  
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,  
Th’ associates and copartners of our loss  
Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,  
And call them not to share with us their part  
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more  
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet  
Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?  

So _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_  
Thus answer’d. Leader of those Armies bright,  
Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,  
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge  
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft  
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge  
Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults  
Their surest signal, they will soon resume </pre></div> </div>
