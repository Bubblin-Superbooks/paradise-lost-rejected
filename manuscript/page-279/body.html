Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate  
In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.  
Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne  
The just Decree of God, pronounc’t and sworn,  
That to his only Son by right endu’d  
With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav’n  
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due  
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist  
Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,  
And equal over equals to let Reigne,  
One over all with unsucceeded power.  
Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute  
With him the points of libertie, who made  
Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow’rs of Heav’n  
Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib’d thir being?  
Yet by experience taught we know how good,  
And of our good, and of our dignitie </pre></div> </div>
