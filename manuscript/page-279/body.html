That Earth nowSeemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,Or wander with delight, and love to hauntHer sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’dUpon the Earth, and man to till the groundNone was, but from the Earth a dewie MistWent up and waterd all the ground, and eachPlant of the field, which e’re it was in the EarthGod made, and every Herb, before it grewOn the green stemm; God saw that it was good:So Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.</p></div> </div>
