Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:  
Here walk’d the Fiend at large in spacious field.  
As when a Vultur on _Imaus_ bred,  
Whose snowie ridge the roving _Tartar_ bounds,  
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey  
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids  
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs  
Of _Ganges_ or _Hydaspes, Indian_ streams;  
But in his way lights on the barren plaines  
Of _Sericana_, where _Chineses_ drive  
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:  
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend  
Walk’d up and down alone bent on his prey,  
Alone, for other Creature in this place  
Living or liveless to be found was none,  
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth  
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew </pre></div> </div>
