Of thickest covert was inwoven shade  
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew  
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side  
_Acanthus_, and each odorous bushie shrub  
Fenc’d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,  
_Iris_ all hues, Roses, and Gessamin  
Rear’d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought  
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,  
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay  
Broiderd the ground, more colour’d then with stone  
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here  
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;  
Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower  
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,  
_Pan_ or _Silvanus_ never slept, nor Nymph,  
Nor _Faunus_ haunted. Here in close recess  
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs </pre></div> </div>
