That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos’d,  
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie  
From this day onward, which I feel begun  
Both in me, and without me, and so last  
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear  
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution  
On my defensless head; both Death and I  
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,  
Nor I on my part single, in mee all  
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie  
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able  
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!  
So disinherited how would ye bless  
Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind  
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn’d,  
If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed,  
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d, </pre></div> </div>
