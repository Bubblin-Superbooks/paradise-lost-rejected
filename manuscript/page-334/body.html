To all his Host on either hand thus spake.  

Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand  
Ye Angels arm’d, this day from Battel rest;  
Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God  
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,  
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don  
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew  
The punishment to other hand belongs,  
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;  
Number to this dayes work is not ordain’d  
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold  
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd  
By mee; not you but mee they have despis’d,  
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,  
Because the Father, t’ whom in Heav’n supream  
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, </pre></div> </div>
