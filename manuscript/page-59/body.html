From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell  
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small  
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind  
Will covet more. With this advantage then  
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,  
More then can be in Heav’n, we now return  
To claim our just inheritance of old,  
Surer to prosper then prosperity  
Could have assur’d us; and by what best way,  
Whether of open Warr or covert guile,  
We now debate; who can advise, may speak.  

He ceas’d, and next him _Moloc_, Scepter’d King  
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit  
That fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair:  
His trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d  
Equal in strength, and rather then be less </pre></div> </div>
