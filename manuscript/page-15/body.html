That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,  
And to the fierce contention brought along  
Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d  
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,  
His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d  
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,  
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?  
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,  
And study of revenge, immortal hate,  
And courage never to submit or yield:  
And what is else not to be overcome?  
That Glory never shall his wrath or might  
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace  
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power  
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late  
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,  
That were an ignominy and shame beneath </pre></div> </div>
