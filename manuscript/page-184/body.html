His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar’d  
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks  
Round from his parted forelock manly hung  
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:  
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste  
Her unadorned golden tresses wore  
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav’d  
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli’d  
Subjection, but requir’d with gentle sway,  
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,  
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,  
And sweet reluctant amorous delay.  
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,  
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame  
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,  
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl’d all mankind  
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, </pre></div> </div>
