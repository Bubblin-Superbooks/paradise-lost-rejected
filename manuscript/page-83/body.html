Conscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.  

O Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones,  
With reason hath deep silence and demurr  
Seis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way  
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;  
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,  
Outrageous to devour, immures us round  
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant  
Barr’d over us prohibit all egress.  
These past, if any pass, the void profound  
Of unessential Night receives him next  
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being  
Threatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.  
If thence he scape into what ever world,  
Or unknown Region, what remains him less  
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. </pre></div> </div>
