Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,  
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard  
By th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,  
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns  
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;  
And scarce to th’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.  

O Visions ill foreseen! better had I  
Liv’d ignorant of future, so had borne  
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot  
Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst  
The burd’n of many Ages, on me light  
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth  
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,  
With thought that they must be. Let no man seek  
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall  
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, </pre></div> </div>
