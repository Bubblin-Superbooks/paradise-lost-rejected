We sunk thus low? Th’ ascent is easie then;  
Th’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke  
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find  
To our destruction: if there be in Hell  
Fear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse  
Then to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d  
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;  
Where pain of unextinguishable fire  
Must exercise us without hope of end  
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge  
Inexorably, and the torturing houre  
Calls us to Penance? More destroy’d then thus  
We should be quite abolisht and expire.  
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense  
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d,  
Will either quite consume us, and reduce  
To nothing this essential, happier farr </pre></div> </div>
