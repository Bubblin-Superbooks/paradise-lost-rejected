From under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie  
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,  
Sent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie  
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain  
Impetuous, and continu’d till the Earth  
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum  
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow  
Rode tilting o’re the Waves, all dwellings else  
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp  
Deep under water rould; Sea cover’d Sea,  
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces  
Where luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d  
And stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,  
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t.  
How didst thou grieve then, _Adam_, to behold  
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,  
Depopulation; thee another Floud, </pre></div> </div>
