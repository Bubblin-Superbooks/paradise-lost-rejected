And now what further shall ensue, behold.  

He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,  
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,  
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie  
Wrinkl’d the face of Deluge, as decai’d;  
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass  
Gaz’d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,  
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink  
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole  
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt  
His Sluces, as the Heav’n his windows shut.  
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground  
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.  
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;  
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive  
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. </pre></div> </div>
