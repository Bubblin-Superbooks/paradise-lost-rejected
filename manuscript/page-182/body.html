The trembling leaves, while Universal _Pan_  
Knit with the _Graces_ and the _Hours_ in dance  
Led on th’ Eternal Spring. Not that faire field  
Of _Enna_, where _Proserpin_ gathring flours  
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie _Dis_  
Was gatherd, which cost _Ceres_ all that pain  
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove  
Of _Daphne_ by _Orontes_, and th’ inspir’d  
_Castalian_ Spring might with this Paradise  
Of _Eden_ strive; nor that _Nyseian_ Ile  
Girt with the River _Triton_, where old _Cham_,  
Whom Gentiles _Ammon_ call and _Libyan Jove_,  
Hid _Amalthea_ and her Florid Son  
Young _Bacchus_ from his Stepdame _Rhea’s_ eye;  
Nor where _Abassin_ Kings thir issue Guard,  
Mount _Amara_, though this by som suppos’d  
True Paradise under the _Ethiop_ Line </pre></div> </div>
