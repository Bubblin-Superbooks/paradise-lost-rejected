Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.  
For solitude somtimes is best societie,  
And short retirement urges sweet returne.  
But other doubt possesses me, least harm  
Befall thee sever’d from me; for thou knowst  
What hath bin warn’d us, what malicious Foe  
Envying our happiness, and of his own  
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame  
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand  
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find  
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,  
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each  
To other speedie aide might lend at need;  
Whether his first design be to withdraw  
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb  
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss  
Enjoy’d by us excites his envie more; </pre></div> </div>
