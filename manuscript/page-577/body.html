Not unperceav’d of _Adam_, who to _Eve_,  
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.  

_Eve_, now expect great tidings, which perhaps  
Of us will soon determin, or impose  
New Laws to be observ’d; for I descrie  
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill  
One of the heav’nly Host, and by his Gate  
None of the meanest, some great Potentate  
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie  
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,  
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,  
As _Raphael_, that I should much confide,  
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,  
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.  
He ended; and th’ Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,  
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man </pre></div> </div>
