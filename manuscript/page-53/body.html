And some the Architect: his hand was known  
In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,  
Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,  
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King  
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,  
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.  
Nor was his name unheard or unador’d  
In ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land  
Men call’d him _Mulciber_; and how he fell  
From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry _Jove_  
Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn  
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,  
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun  
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,  
On _Lemnos_ th’ _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate,  
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout  
Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now </pre></div> </div>
