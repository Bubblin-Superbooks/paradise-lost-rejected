But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,  
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.  
This Eevning from the Sun’s decline arriv’d  
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen  
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap’d  
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:  
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.  

So saying, on he led his radiant Files,  
Daz’ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct  
In search of whom they sought: him there they found  
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of _Eve_;  
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach  
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge  
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,  
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint  
Th’ animal Spirits that from pure blood arise </pre></div> </div>
