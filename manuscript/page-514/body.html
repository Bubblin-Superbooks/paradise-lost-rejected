From out of _Chaos_ to the outside bare  
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant  
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made  
And durable; and now in little space  
The Confines met of Empyrean Heav’n  
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell  
With long reach interpos’d; three sev’ral wayes  
In sight, to each of these three places led.  
And now thir way to Earth they had descri’d,  
To Paradise first tending, when behold  
_Satan_ in likeness of an Angel bright  
Betwixt the _Centaure_ and the _Scorpion_ stearing  
His _Zenith_, while the Sun in _Aries_ rose:  
Disguis’d he came, but those his Children dear  
Thir Parent soon discern’d, though in disguise.  
Hee, after _Eve_ seduc’t, unminded slunk  
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape </pre></div> </div>
