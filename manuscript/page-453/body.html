With ravishment beheld, there best beheld  
Where universally admir’d; but here  
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,  
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne  
Half what in thee is fair, one man except,  
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen

By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.

Into the Heart of _Eve_ his words made way,  
Though at the voice much marveling; at length  
Not unamaz’d she thus in answer spake.  
What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc’t  
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?  
The first at lest of these I thought deni’d </pre></div> </div>
