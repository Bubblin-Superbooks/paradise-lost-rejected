Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire  
To his grim Idol. Him the _Ammonite_  
Worshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain,  
In _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream  
Of utmost _Arnon_. Nor content with such  
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart  
Of _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build  
His Temple right against the Temple of God  
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove  
The pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence  
And black _Gehenna_ call’d, the Type of Hell.  
Next _Chemos_, th’ obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons,  
From _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild  
Of Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_  
And _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond  
The flowry Dale of _Sibma_ clad with Vines,  
And _Eleale_ to th’ _Asphaltick_ Pool. </pre></div> </div>
