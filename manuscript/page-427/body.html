If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange  
Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,  
Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,  
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these  
Find place or refuge; and the more I see  
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel  
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege  
Of contraries; all good to me becomes  
Bane, and in Heav’n much worse would be my state.  
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav’n  
To dwell, unless by maistring Heav’ns Supreame;  
Nor hope to be my self less miserable  
By what I seek, but others to make such  
As I though thereby worse to me redound:  
For onely in destroying I finde ease  
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,  
Or won to what may work his utter loss, </pre></div> </div>
