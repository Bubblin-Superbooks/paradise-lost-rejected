Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes  
A militarie Vest of purple flowd  
Livelier then _Meliboean_, or the graine  
Of _Sarra_, worn by Kings and Hero’s old  
In time of Truce; _Iris_ had dipt the wooff;  
His starrie Helme unbuckl’d shew’d him prime  
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side  
As in a glistering _Zodiac_ hung the Sword,  
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.  
_Adam_ bowd low, hee Kingly from his State  
Inclin’d not, but his coming thus declar’d.  

_Adam_, Heav’ns high behest no Preface needs:  
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,  
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,  
Defeated of his seisure many dayes  
Giv’n thee of Grace, wherein thou may’st repent, </pre></div> </div>
