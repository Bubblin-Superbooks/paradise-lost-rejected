New courage and revive, though now they lye  
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,  
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,  
No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.  

He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend  
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield  
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,  
Behind him cast; the broad circumference  
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb  
Through Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views  
At Ev’ning from the top of _Fesole_,  
Or in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands,  
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.  
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine  
Hewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast  
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, </pre></div> </div>
