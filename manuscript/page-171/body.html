_Disdain_ forbids me, and my dread of shame  
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc’d  
With other promises and other vaunts  
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue  
Th’ Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know  
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,  
Under what torments inwardly I groane;  
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,  
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc’d  
The lower still I fall, onely Supream  
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.  
But say I could repent and could obtaine  
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon  
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay  
What feign’d submission swore: ease would recant  
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.  
For never can true reconcilement grow </pre></div> </div>
