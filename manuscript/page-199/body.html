The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung  
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.  
Betwixt these rockie Pillars _Gabriel_ sat  
Chief of th’ Angelic Guards, awaiting night;  
About him exercis’d Heroic Games  
Th’ unarmed Youth of Heav’n, but nigh at hand  
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares  
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.  
Thither came _Uriel_, gliding through the Eeven  
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr  
In _Autumn_ thwarts the night, when vapors fir’d  
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner  
From what point of his Compass to beware  
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.  

_Gabriel_, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv’n  
Charge and strict watch that to this happie place </pre></div> </div>
