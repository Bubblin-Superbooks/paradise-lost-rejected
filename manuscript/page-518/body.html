Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.  
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,

Of _Satan_ (for I glorie in the name,  
Antagonist of Heav’ns Almightie King)

Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent  
Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I  
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease  
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint  
With these successes, and with them rejoyce,  
You two this way, among those numerous Orbs  
All yours, right down to Paradise descend; </pre></div> </div>
