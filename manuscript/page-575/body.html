O _Eve_, some furder change awaits us nigh,  
Which Heav’n by these mute signs in Nature shews  
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn  
Us haply too secure of our discharge  
From penaltie, because from death releast  
Some days; how long, and what till then our life,  
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,  
And thither must return and be no more.  
VVhy else this double object in our sight  
Of flight pursu’d in th’ Air and ore the ground  
One way the self-same hour? why in the East  
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light  
More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws  
O’re the blew Firmament a radiant white,  
And slow descends, with somthing heav’nly fraught. </pre></div> </div>
