_Ophion_ with _Eurynome_, the wide-  
Encroaching _Eve_ perhaps, had first the rule  
Of high _Olympus_, thence by _Saturn_ driv’n  
And _Ops_, ere yet _Dictaean_ _Jove_ was born.  
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair  
Too soon arriv’d, _Sin_ there in power before,  
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell  
Habitual habitant; behind her _Death_  
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet  
On his pale Horse: to whom _Sin_ thus began.  

Second of _Satan_ sprung, all conquering Death,  
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd  
With travail difficult, not better farr  
Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,  
Unnam’d, undreaded, and thy self half starv’d? </pre></div> </div>
