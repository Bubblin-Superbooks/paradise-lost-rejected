Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest  
That Bodies bright and greater should not serve  
The less not bright, nor Heav’n such journies run,  
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves  
The benefit: consider first, that Great  
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth  
Though, in comparison of Heav’n, so small,  
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe  
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,  
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,  
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd  
His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.  
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries  
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.  
And for the Heav’ns wide Circuit, let it speak  
The Makers high magnificence, who built  
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; </pre></div> </div>
