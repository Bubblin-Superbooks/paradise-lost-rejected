With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect  
His Stature, and upright with Front serene

Directed in Devotion, to adore  
And worship God Supream, who made him chief  
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent

In our similitude, and let them rule  
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,  
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, </pre></div> </div>
