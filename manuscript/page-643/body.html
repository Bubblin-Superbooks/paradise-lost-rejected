To save them, not thir own, though legal works.  
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem’d,  
Seis’d on by force, judg’d, and to death condemnd  
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross  
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;  
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,  
The Law that is against thee, and the sins  
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi’d,  
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust  
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,  
But soon revives, Death over him no power  
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light  
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise  
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,  
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,  
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life  
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace </pre></div> </div>
