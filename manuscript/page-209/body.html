Espoused _Eve_ deckt first her Nuptial Bed,  
And heav’nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,  
What day the genial Angel to our Sire  
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn’d,  
More lovely then _Pandora_, whom the Gods  
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like  
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son  
Of _Japhet_ brought by _Hermes_, she ensnar’d  
Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng’d  
On him who had stole _Joves_ authentic fire.  

Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv’d, both stood,  
Both turnd, and under op’n Skie ador’d  
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav’n  
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe  
And starrie Pole: Thou also mad’st the Night,  
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, </pre></div> </div>
