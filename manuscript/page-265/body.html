<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">a lower Clime)Dismounted, on th’ <em>Aleian</em> Field I fallErroneous, there to wander and forlorne.Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower boundWithin the visible Diurnal Spheare;Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang’dTo hoarce or mute, though fall’n on evil dayes,On evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,And solitude; yet not alone, while thouVisit’st my slumbers Nightly, or when MornPurples the East: still govern thou my Song,<em>Urania</em>, and fit audience find, though few.But drive farr off the barbarous dissonanceOf <em>Bacchus</em> and his Revellers, the RaceOf that wilde Rout that tore the <em>Thracian</em> BardIn <em>Rhodope</em>, where Woods and Rocks had EaresTo rapture, till the savage clamor droundBoth Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defendHer Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:For thou art Heav’nlie, shee an empty dreame.</p></div> </div>
