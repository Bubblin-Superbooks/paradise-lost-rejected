So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;  
For neither Man nor Angel can discern  
Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks  
Invisible, except to God alone,  
By his permissive will, through Heav’n and Earth:  
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps  
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie  
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill  
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil’d  
_Uriel_, though Regent of the Sun, and held  
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav’n;  
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule  
In his uprightness answer thus returnd.  
Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know  
The works of God, thereby to glorifie  
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess </pre></div> </div>
