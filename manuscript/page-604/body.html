Assaulting; others from the Wall defend  
With Dart and Jav’lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;  
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.  
In other part the scepter’d Haralds call  
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon  
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,  
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon  
In factious opposition, till at last  
Of middle Age one rising, eminent  
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,  
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,  
And Judgement from above: him old and young  
Exploded, and had seiz’d with violent hands,  
Had not a Cloud descending snatch’d him thence  
Unseen amid the throng: so violence  
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law  
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. </pre></div> </div>
