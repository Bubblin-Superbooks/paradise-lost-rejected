And dying rise, and rising with him raise  
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.  
So Heav’nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,  
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,  
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate  
So easily destroy’d, and still destroyes  
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.  
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume  
Mans Nature, less’n or degrade thine owne.  
Because thou hast, though Thron’d in highest bliss  
Equal to God, and equally enjoying  
God-like fruition, quitted all to save  
A World from utter loss, and hast been found  
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,  
Found worthiest to be so by being Good,  
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee  
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, </pre></div> </div>
