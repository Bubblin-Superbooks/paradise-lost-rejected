Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit  
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud  
He comes, and settl’d in his face I see  
Sad resolution and secure: let each  
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each  
Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,  
Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,  
If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,  
But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.  
So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon  
In order, quit of all impediment;  
Instant without disturb they took Allarm,  
And onward move Embattelld; when behold  
Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe  
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube  
Training his devilish Enginrie, impal’d  
On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, </pre></div> </div>
