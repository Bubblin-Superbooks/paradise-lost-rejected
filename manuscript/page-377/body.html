Author and end of all things, and from work  
Now resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,  
As resting on that day from all his work,  
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp  
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,  
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,  
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire  
Temper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice  
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds  
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.  
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,  
Great are thy works, _Jehovah_, infinite  
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue  
Relate thee; greater now in thy return  
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day  
Thy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create  
Is greater then created to destroy. </pre></div> </div>
