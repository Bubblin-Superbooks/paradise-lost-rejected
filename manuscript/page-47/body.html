That all these puissant Legions, whose exile  
Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend  
Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.  
For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,  
If counsels different, or danger shun’d  
By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns  
Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure  
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,  
Consent or custome, and his Regal State  
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,  
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.  
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own  
So as not either to provoke, or dread  
New warr, provok’t; our better part remains  
To work in close design, by fraud or guile  
What force effected not: that he no less  
At length from us may find, who overcomes </pre></div> </div>
