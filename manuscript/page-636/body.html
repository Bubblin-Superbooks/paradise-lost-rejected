Just for unjust, that in such righteousness  
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde  
Justification towards God, and peace  
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies  
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part  
Perform, and not performing cannot live.  
So Law appears imperfet, and but giv’n  
With purpose to resign them in full time  
Up to a better Cov’nant, disciplin’d  
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,  
From imposition of strict Laws, to free  
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear  
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.  
And therefore shall not _Moses_, though of God  
Highly belov’d, being but the Minister  
Of Law, his people into _Canaan_ lead;  
But _Joshua_ whom the Gentiles _Jesus_ call, </pre></div> </div>
