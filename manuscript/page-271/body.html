To utter is not safe. Assemble thou  
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;

The Quarters of the North, there to prepare  
Fit entertainment to receive our King  
The great _Messiah_, and his new commands,

Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.

Bad influence into th’ unwarie brest  
Of his Associate; hee together calls,  
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, </pre></div> </div>
