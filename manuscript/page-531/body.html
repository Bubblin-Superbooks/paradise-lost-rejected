Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.  
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,  
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,  
There best, where most with ravin I may meet;  
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems  
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.  

To whom th’ incestuous Mother thus repli’d.  
Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours  
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,  
No homely morsels, and whatever thing  
The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar’d,  
Till I in Man residing through the Race,  
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,  
And season him thy last and sweetest prey. </pre></div> </div>
