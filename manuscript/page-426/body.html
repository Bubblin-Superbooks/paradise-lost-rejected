O Earth, how like to Heav’n, if not preferrd  
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built  
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!  
For what God after better worse would build?  
Terrestrial Heav’n, danc’t round by other Heav’ns  
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,  
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,  
In thee concentring all thir precious beams  
Of sacred influence: As God in Heav’n  
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou  
Centring receav’st from all those Orbs; in thee,  
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers  
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth  
Of Creatures animate with gradual life  
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ’d up in Man.  
With what delight could I have walkt thee round </pre></div> </div>
