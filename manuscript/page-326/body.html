Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav’n  
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,  
Had not th’ Almightie Father where he sits  
Shrin’d in his Sanctuarie of Heav’n secure,  
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen  
This tumult, and permitted all, advis’d:  
That his great purpose he might so fulfill,  
To honour his Anointed Son aveng’d  
Upon his enemies, and to declare  
All power on him transferr’d: whence to his Son  
Th’ Assessor of his Throne he thus began.  

Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov’d,  
Son in whose face invisible is beheld  
Visibly, what by Deitie I am,  
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,  
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, </pre></div> </div>
