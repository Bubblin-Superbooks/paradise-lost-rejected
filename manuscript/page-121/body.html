Or of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam  
May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,  
And never but in unapproached light  
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,  
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.  
Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,  
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,  
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice  
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest  
The rising world of waters dark and deep,  
Won from the void and formless infinite.  
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,  
Escap’t the _Stygian_ Pool, though long detain’d  
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight </pre></div> </div>
