Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound  
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt  
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine  
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought  
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw  
The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes  
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves  
To manifest the more thy might: his evil  
Thou usest, and from thence creat’st more good.  
Witness this new-made World, another Heav’n  
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view  
On the cleer _Hyaline_, the Glassie Sea;  
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr’s  
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World  
Of destind habitation; but thou know’st  
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,  
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus’d, </pre></div> </div>
