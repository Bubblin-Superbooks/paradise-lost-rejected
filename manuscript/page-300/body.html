Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then  
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale  
The Battel hung; till _Satan_, who that day  
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes  
No equal, raunging through the dire attack  
Of fighting Seraphim confus’d, at length  
Saw where the Sword of _Michael_ smote, and fell’d  
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway  
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down  
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand  
He hasted, and oppos’d the rockie Orb  
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield  
A vast circumference: At his approach  
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile  
Surceas’d, and glad as hoping here to end  
Intestine War in Heav’n, the arch foe subdu’d  
Or Captive drag’d in Chains, with hostile frown </pre></div> </div>
