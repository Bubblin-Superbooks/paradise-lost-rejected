But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon  
Culminate from th’ _Aequator_, as they now  
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round  
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,  
No where so cleer, sharp’nd his visual ray  
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon  
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,  
The same whom _John_ saw also in the Sun:  
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;  
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar  
Circl’d his Head, nor less his Locks behind  
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings  
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy’d  
Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.  
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope  
To find who might direct his wandring flight  
To Paradise the happie seat of Man, </pre></div> </div>
