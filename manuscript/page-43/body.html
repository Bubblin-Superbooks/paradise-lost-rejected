Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,  
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief  
Had to impose: He through the armed Files  
Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse  
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,  
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,  
Thir number last he summs. And now his heart  
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength  
Glories: For never since created man,  
Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these  
Could merit more then that small infantry  
Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood  
Of _Phlegra_ with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d  
That fought at _Theb’s_ and _Ilium_, on each side  
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds  
In Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son  
Begirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights; </pre></div> </div>
