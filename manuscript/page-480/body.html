Direct, or by occasion hath presented  
This happie trial of thy Love, which else  
So eminently never had bin known.  
Were it I thought Death menac’t would ensue  
This my attempt, I would sustain alone  
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die  
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact  
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur’d  
Remarkably so late of thy so true,  
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel  
Farr otherwise th’ event, not Death, but Life  
Augmented, op’nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,  
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before  
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.  
On my experience, _Adam_, freely taste,  
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. </pre></div> </div>
