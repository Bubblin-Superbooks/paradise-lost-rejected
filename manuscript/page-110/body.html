And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,  
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,  
Which but her self not all the _Stygian_ powers  
Could once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns  
Th’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar  
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease  
Unfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie  
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound  
Th’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great  
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook  
Of _Erebus_. She op’nd, but to shut  
Excel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood,  
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host  
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through  
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;  
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth  
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. </pre></div> </div>
