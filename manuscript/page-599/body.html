Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent  
To worship God aright, and know his works  
Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve  
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain  
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold  
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay  
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung  
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:  
The Men though grave, ey’d them, and let thir eyes  
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net  
Fast caught, they lik’d, and each his liking chose;  
And now of love they treat till th’ Eevning Star  
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat  
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke  
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok’t;  
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.  
Such happy interview and fair event </pre></div> </div>
