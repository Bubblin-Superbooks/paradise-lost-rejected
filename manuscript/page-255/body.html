From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.  
The Sun that light imparts to all, receives  
From all his alimental recompence  
In humid exhalations, and at Even  
Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav’n the Trees  
Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines  
Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn  
We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground  
Cover’d with pearly grain: yet God hath here  
Varied his bounty so with new delights,  
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste  
Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,  
And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly  
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss  
Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch  
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate  
To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires </pre></div> </div>
