As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns  
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;  
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:  
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:  
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks  
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:  
The grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d  
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free  
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,  
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,  
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale  
Rising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw  
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground  
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould  
_Behemoth_ biggest born of Earth upheav’d  
His vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,  
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land </pre></div> </div>
