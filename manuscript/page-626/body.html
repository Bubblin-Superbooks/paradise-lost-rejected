His benediction so, that in his Seed  
All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,  
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:  
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith  
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile  
_Ur_ of _Chaldaea_, passing now the Ford  
To _Haran_, after him a cumbrous Train  
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;  
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth  
With God, who call’d him, in a land unknown.  
_Canaan_ he now attains, I see his Tents  
Pitcht about _Sechem_, and the neighbouring Plaine  
Of _Moreb_ there by promise he receaves  
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;  
From _Hamath_ Northward to the Desert South  
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam’d)  
From _Hermon_ East to the great Western Sea, </pre></div> </div>
