Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg’d to Hell  
Com’st thou, escap’d thy prison, and transform’d,  
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite  
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?  

Know ye not then said _Satan_, filld with scorn,  
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate  
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;  
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,  
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,  
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin  
Your message, like to end as much in vain?  
To whom thus _Zephon_, answering scorn with scorn.  
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,  
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known  
As when thou stoodst in Heav’n upright and pure; </pre></div> </div>
