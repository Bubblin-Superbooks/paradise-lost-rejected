So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but _Eve_  
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli’d.  

With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd  
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words  
Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,  
May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar’d,  
The willinger I goe, nor much expect  
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;  
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.  
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand  
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light  
_Oread_ or _Dryad_, or of _Delia’s_ Traine,  
Betook her to the Groves, but _Delia’s_ self  
In gate surpass’d and Goddess-like deport,  
Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, </pre></div> </div>
