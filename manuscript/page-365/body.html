And God created the great Whales, and each  
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously  
The waters generated by thir kindes,  
And every Bird of wing after his kinde;  
And saw that it was good, and bless’d them, saying,  
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas  
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;  
And let the Fowle be multiply’d on the Earth.  
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay  
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales  
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales  
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft  
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate  
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves  
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance  
Show to the Sun thir wav’d coats dropt with Gold,  
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend </pre></div> </div>
