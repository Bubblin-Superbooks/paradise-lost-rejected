Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side  
That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.  
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,  
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,  
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.  

To whom the Virgin Majestie of _Eve_,  
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,  
With sweet austeer composure thus reply’d.  

Ofspring of Heav’n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,  
That such an enemie we have, who seeks  
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,  
And from the parting Angel over-heard  
As in a shadie nook I stood behind,  
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.  
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt </pre></div> </div>
