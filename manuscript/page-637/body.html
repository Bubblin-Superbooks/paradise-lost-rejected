His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell  
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back  
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man  
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.  
Meanwhile they in thir earthly _Canaan_ placâ€™t  
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins  
National interrupt thir public peace,  
Provoking God to raise them enemies:  
From whom as oft he saves them penitent  
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom  
The second, both for pietie renownd  
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive  
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne  
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing  
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock  
Of _David_ (so I name this King) shall rise  
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, </pre></div> </div>
