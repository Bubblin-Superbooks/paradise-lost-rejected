Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze  
Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d  
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s  
Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,  
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.  

There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top  
Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire  
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign  
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,  
The work of Sulphur. Thither wing’d with speed  
A numerous Brigad hasten’d. As when bands  
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d  
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,  
Or cast a Rampart. _Mammon_ led them on,  
_Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell  
From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks & thoughts </pre></div> </div>
