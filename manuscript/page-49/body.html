But perhapsThe way seems difficult and steep to scaleWith upright wing against a higher foe.Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drenchOf that forgetful Lake benumme not still,That in our proper motion we ascendUp to our native seat: descent and fallTo us is adverse. Who but felt of lateWhen the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n RearInsulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,With what compulsion and laborious flightWe sunk thus low? Th’ ascent is easie then;Th’ event is fear’d; should we again provokeOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may findTo our destruction:</p></div> </div>
