To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape  
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent  
With his industrious crew to build in hell.  
Mean while the winged Haralds by command  
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony

A solemn Councel forthwith to be held

With hundreds and with thousands trooping came  
Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates  
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall  
(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold  
Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair  
Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry </pre></div> </div>
