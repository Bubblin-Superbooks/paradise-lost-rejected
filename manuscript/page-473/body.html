Mean I to trie, what rash untri’d I sought,  
The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange  
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:  
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree  
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown  
Op’ning the way, but of Divine effect  
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;  
And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,  
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,  
Hath eat’n of the fruit, and is become,  
Not dead, as we are threatn’d, but thenceforth  
Endu’d with human voice and human sense,  
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee  
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I  
Have also tasted, and have also found  
Th’ effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,  
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, </pre></div> </div>
