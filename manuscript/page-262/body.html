My self and all th’ Angelic Host that stand  
In sight of God enthron’d, our happie state  
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;  
On other surety none; freely we serve.  
Because wee freely love, as in our will  
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:  
And som are fall’n, to disobedience fall’n,  
And so from Heav’n to deepest Hell; O fall  
From what high state of bliss into what woe!  

To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words  
Attentive, and with more delighted eare  
Divine instructer, I have heard, then when  
Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills  
Aereal Music send: nor knew I not  
To be both will and deed created free;  
Yet that we never shall forget to love </pre></div> </div>
