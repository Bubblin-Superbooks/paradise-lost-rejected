Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate  
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;  
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest  
How suttly to detaine thee I devise,  
Inviting thee to hear while I relate,  
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:  
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav’n,  
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare  
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst  
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre  
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,  
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine  
Imbu’d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.  

To whom thus _Raphael_ answer’d heav’nly meek.  
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,  
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee </pre></div> </div>
