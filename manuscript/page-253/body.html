Then with these various fruits the Trees of God  
Have heap’d this Table. Rais’d of grassie terf  
Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,  
And on her ample Square from side to side  
All _Autumn_ pil’d, though _Spring_ and _Autumn_ here  
Danc’d hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;

To us for food and for delight hath caus’d  
The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps  
To spiritual Natures; only this I know,  
That one Celestial Father gives to all.  

To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives </pre></div> </div>
