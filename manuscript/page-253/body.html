<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">in whose hand what by Decree I doe,Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,Since <em>Michael</em> and his Powers went forth to tameThese disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,Equal in their Creation they were form’d,Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wroughtInsensibly, for I suspend thir doom;Whence in perpetual fight they needs must lastEndless, and no solution will be found:Warr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,And to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,With Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makesWild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;For thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farrHave sufferd, that the Glorie may be thineOf ending this great Warr, since none but ThouCan end it.
