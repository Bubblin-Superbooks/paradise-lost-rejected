The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found  
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl’d,  
His head the midst, well stor’d with suttle wiles:  
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,  
Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe  
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth  
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,  
In heart or head, possessing soon inspir’d  
With act intelligential; but his sleep  
Disturbd not, waiting close th’ approach of Morn.  
Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne  
In _Eden_ on the humid Flours, that breathd  
Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,  
From th’ Earths great Altar send up silent praise  
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill  
With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair  
And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire </pre></div> </div>
