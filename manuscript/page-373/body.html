And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.  
This said, he formd thee, _Adam_, thee O Man  
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath’d  
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee  
Created thee, in the Image of God  
Express, and thou becam’st a living Soul.

Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold  
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,  
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.  
Wherever thus created, for no place  
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know’st  
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,  
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,  
Delectable both to behold and taste; </pre></div> </div>
