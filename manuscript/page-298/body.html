Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles  
Of brazen Chariots rag’d; dire was the noise  
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss  
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,  
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.  
Sounder fierie Cope together rush’d  
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault  
And inextinguishable rage; all Heav’n  
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth  
Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when  
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought  
On either side, the least of whom could weild  
These Elements, and arm him with the force  
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power  
Armie against Armie numberless to raise  
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,  
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; </pre></div> </div>
