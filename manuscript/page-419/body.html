Gentle to me and affable hath been  
Thy condescension, and shall be honour’d ever  
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind  
Be good and friendly still, and oft return.  

So parted they, the Angel up to Heav’n  
From the thick shade, and _Adam_ to his Bowre.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
