_Peor_ his other Name, when he entic’d  
_Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_  
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.  
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d  
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove  
Of _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate;  
Till good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell.  
With these came they, who from the bordring flood  
Of old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts  
_Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names  
Of _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male,  
These Feminine. For Spirits when they please  
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft  
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,  
Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,  
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,  
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose </pre></div> </div>
