Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure  
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East  
To journie through the airie gloom began,  
Sphear’d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun  
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle  
Sojourn’d the while. God saw the Light was good;  
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere  
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night  
He nam’d. Thus was the first Day Eev’n and Morn:  
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung  
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light  
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;  
Birth-day of Heav’n and Earth; with joy and shout  
The hollow Universal Orb they fill’d,  
And touch’t thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais’d  
God and his works, Creatour him they sung,  
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. </pre></div> </div>
