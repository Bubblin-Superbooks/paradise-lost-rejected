Of that life-giving Plant, but only us’d  
For prospect, what well us’d had bin the pledge  
Of immortalitie. So little knows  
Any, but God alone, to value right  
The good before him, but perverts best things  
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.  
Beneath him with new wonder now he views  
To all delight of human sense expos’d  
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,  
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise  
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East  
Of _Eden_ planted; _Eden_ stretchd her Line  
From _Auran_ Eastward to the Royal Towrs  
Of great _Seleucia_, built by _Grecian_ Kings,  
Or where the Sons of _Eden_ long before  
Dwelt in _Telassar:_ in this pleasant soile  
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; </pre></div> </div>
