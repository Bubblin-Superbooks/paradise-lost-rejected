And they outcast from God, are here condemn’d  
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?  
And reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,  
Hell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn,  
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,  
Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,  
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,  
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue  
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart  
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.  

So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,  
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold  
More dreadful and deform: on th’ other side  
Incenc’t with indignation _Satan_ stood  
Unterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,  
That fires the length of _Ophiucus_ huge </pre></div> </div>
