Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,  
But with addition strange; yet be not sad.  
Evil into the mind of God or Man  
May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave  
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope  
That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,  
Waking thou never wilt consent to do.  
Be not disheart’nd then, nor cloud those looks  
That wont to be more chearful and serene  
Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,  
And let us to our fresh imployments rise  
Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours  
That open now thir choicest bosom’d smells  
Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.  

So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,  
But silently a gentle tear let fall </pre></div> </div>
