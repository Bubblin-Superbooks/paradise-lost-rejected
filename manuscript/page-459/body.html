Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night  
Condenses, and the cold invirons round,  
Kindl’d through agitation to a Flame,  
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,  
Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,  
Misleads th’ amaz’d Night-wanderer from his way  
To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole,  
There swallow’d up and lost, from succour farr.  
So glister’d the dire Snake and into fraud  
Led _Eve_ our credulous Mother, to the Tree  
Of prohibition, root of all our woe;  
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.  

Serpent, we might have spar’d our coming hither,  
Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,  
The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,  
Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. </pre></div> </div>
