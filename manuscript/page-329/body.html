He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct  
Shon full, he all his Father full exprest  
Ineffably into his face receiv’d,  
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.  

O Father, O Supream of heav’nly Thrones,  
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst  
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,  
As is most just; this I my Glorie account,  
My exaltation, and my whole delight,  
That thou in me well pleas’d, declarst thy will  
Fulfill’d, which to fulfil is all my bliss.  
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,  
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end  
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee  
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov’st: </pre></div> </div>
