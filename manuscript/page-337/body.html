Glar’d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire  
Among th’ accurst, that witherd all thir strength,  
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,  
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall’n.  
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check’d  
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant  
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav’n:  
The overthrown he rais’d, and as a Heard  
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd  
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu’d  
With terrors and with furies to the bounds  
And Chrystall wall of Heav’n, which op’ning wide,  
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos’d  
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight  
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse  
Urg’d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw  
Down from the verge of Heav’n, Eternal wrauth </pre></div> </div>
