Err not) another World, the happy seat  
Of som new Race call’d _Man_, about this time  
To be created like to us, though less  
In power and excellence, but favour’d more  
Of him who rules above; so was his will  
Pronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,  
That shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.  
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn  
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,  
Or substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,  
And where thir weakness, how attempted best,  
By force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,  
And Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure  
In his own strength, this place may lye expos’d  
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left  
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps  
Som advantagious act may be achiev’d </pre></div> </div>
