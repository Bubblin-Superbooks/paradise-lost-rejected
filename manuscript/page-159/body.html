His journies end and our beginning woe.  
But first he casts to change his proper shape,  
Which else might work him danger or delay:  
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,  
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face  
Youth smil’d Celestial, and to every Limb  
Sutable grace diffus’d, so well he feignd;  
Under a Coronet his flowing haire  
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore  
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl’d with Gold,  
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held  
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.  
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,  
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,  
Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known  
Th’ Arch-Angel _Uriel_, one of the seav’n  
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne </pre></div> </div>
