Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles  
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,  
All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon  
Among them he arriv’d; in his right hand  
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent  
Before him, such as in thir Soules infix’d  
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,  
All courage; down thir idle weapons drop’d;  
O’re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode  
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,  
That wish’d the Mountains now might be again  
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.  
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell  
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag’d Foure,  
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,  
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,  
One Spirit in them rul’d, and every eye </pre></div> </div>
