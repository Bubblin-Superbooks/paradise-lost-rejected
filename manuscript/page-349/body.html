Know then, that after _Lucifer_ from Heav’n  
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host  
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)  
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep  
Into his place, and the great Son returnd  
Victorious with his Saints, th’ Omnipotent  
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld  
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.  

At least our envious Foe hath fail’d, who thought  
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid  
This inaccessible high strength, the seat  
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,  
He trusted to have seis’d, and into fraud  
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;  
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, </pre></div> </div>
