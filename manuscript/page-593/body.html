Numbers of all diseas’d, all maladies  
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes  
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,  
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,  
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,  
Dropsies, and Asthma’s, and Joint-racking Rheums.  
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair  
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;  
And over them triumphant Death his Dart  
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok’t  
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.  
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long  
Drie-ey’d behold? _Adam_ could not, but wept,  
Though not of Woman born; compassion quell’d  
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears  
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,  
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew’d. </pre></div> </div>
