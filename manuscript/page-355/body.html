One foot he center’d, and the other turn’d  
Round through the vast profunditie obscure,  
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,  
This be thy just Circumference, O World.  
Thus God the Heav’n created, thus the Earth,  
Matter unform’d and void: Darkness profound  
Cover’d th’ Abyss: but on the watrie calme  
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,  
And vital vertue infus’d, and vital warmth  
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg’d  
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs  
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob’d  
Like things to like, the rest to several place  
Disparted, and between spun out the Air,  
And Earth self-ballanc’t on her Center hung.  

Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light </pre></div> </div>
