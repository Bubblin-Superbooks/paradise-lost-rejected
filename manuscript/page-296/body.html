When he who rules is worthiest, and excells  
Them whom he governs. This is servitude,  
To serve th’ unwise, or him who hath rebelld  
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,  
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall’d;  
Yet leudly dar’st our ministring upbraid.  
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve  
In Heav’n God ever blessed, and his Divine  
Behests obey, worthiest to be obey’d,  
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while  
From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,  
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.  

So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,  
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell  
On the proud Crest of _Satan_, that no sight,  
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield </pre></div> </div>
