Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both  
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard  
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes  
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin’d, they heard  
And from his presence hid themselves among  
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God  
Approaching, thus to _Adam_ call’d aloud.  

Where art thou _Adam_, wont with joy to meet  
My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,  
Not pleas’d, thus entertaind with solitude,  
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear’d unsaught:  
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change  
Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth.  
He came, and with him _Eve_, more loth, though first  
To offend, discount’nanc’t both, and discompos’d;  
Love was not in thir looks, either to God </pre></div> </div>
