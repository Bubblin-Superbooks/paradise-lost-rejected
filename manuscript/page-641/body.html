What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,  
Why our great expectation should be call’d  
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,  
High in the love of Heav’n, yet from my Loynes  
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son  
Of God most High; So God with man unites.  
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise  
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when  
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.  

To whom thus _Michael_. Dream not of thir fight,  
As of a Duel, or the local wounds  
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son  
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil  
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome  
_Satan_, whose fall from Heav’n, a deadlier bruise,  
Disabl’d not to give thee thy deaths wound: </pre></div> </div>
