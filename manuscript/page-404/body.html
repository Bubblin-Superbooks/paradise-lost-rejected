No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.  
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,  
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest  
Of happiness, or not? who am alone  
From all Eternitie, for none I know  
Second to mee or like, equal much less.  
How have I then with whom to hold converse  
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those  
To me inferiour, infinite descents  
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?  

He ceas’d, I lowly answer’d. To attaine  
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes  
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;  
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee  
Is no deficience found; not so is Man,  
But in degree, the cause of his desire </pre></div> </div>
