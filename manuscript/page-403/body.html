Giv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie  
The one intense, the other still remiss  
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove  
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak  
Such as I seek, fit to participate  
All rational delight, wherein the brute  
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce  
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;  
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;  
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle  
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;  
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.  

Whereto th’ Almighty answer’d, not displeas’d.  
A nice and suttle happiness I see  
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice  
Of thy Associates, _Adam_, and wilt taste </pre></div> </div>
