Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,  
Since _Michael_ and his Powers went forth to tame  
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,  
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;  
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,  
Equal in their Creation they were form’d,  
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought  
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;  
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last  
Endless, and no solution will be found:  
Warr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,  
And to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,  
With Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makes  
Wild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.  
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;  
For thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farr  
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine </pre></div> </div>
