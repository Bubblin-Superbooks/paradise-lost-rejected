Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,  
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day  
That must be mortal to us both. O flours,  
That never will in other Climate grow,  
My early visitation, and my last  
At Eev’n, which I bred up with tender hand  
From the first op’ning bud, and gave ye Names,  
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke  
Your Tribes, and water from th’ ambrosial Fount?  
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd  
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee  
How shall I part, and whither wander down  
Into a lower World, to this obscure  
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire  
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?  

Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. </pre></div> </div>
