God hath assign’d us, nor of me shalt pass  
Unprais’d: for nothing lovelier can be found  
In woman, then to studie houshold good,  
And good workes in her Husband to promote.  
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos’d  
Labour, as to debarr us when we need  
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,  
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse  
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,  
To brute deni’d, and are of Love the food,  
Love not the lowest end of human life.  
For not to irksom toile, but to delight  
He made us, and delight to Reason joyn’d.  
These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt  
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide  
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long  
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps </pre></div> </div>
