Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign’d,  
The way which to her ruin now I tend.  

So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos’d  
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward _Eve_  
Address’d his way, not with indented wave,  
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,  
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour’d  
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head  
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;  
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect  
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass  
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,  
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind  
Lovelier, not those that in _Illyria_ chang’d  
_Hermione_ and _Cadmus_, or the God  
In _Epidaurus_; nor to which transformd </pre></div> </div>
