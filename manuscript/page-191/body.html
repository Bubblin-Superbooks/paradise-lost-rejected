That rais’d us from the dust and plac’t us here  
In all this happiness, who at his hand  
Have nothing merited, nor can performe  
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires  
From us no other service then to keep  
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees  
In Paradise that beare delicious fruit  
So various, not to taste that onely Tree  
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,  
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,  
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst  
God hath pronounc’t it death to taste that Tree,  
The only sign of our obedience left  
Among so many signes of power and rule  
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv’n  
Over all other Creatures that possesse  
Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard </pre></div> </div>
