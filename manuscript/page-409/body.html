To make her amiable: On she came,  
Led by her Heav’nly Maker, though unseen,  
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd  
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:  
Grace was in all her steps, Heav’n in her Eye,  
In every gesture dignitie and love.  
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.  

This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill’d  
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,  
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this  
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see  
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self  
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man  
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe  
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;  
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. </pre></div> </div>
