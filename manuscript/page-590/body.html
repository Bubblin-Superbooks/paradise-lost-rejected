A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought  
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,  
Uncull’d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next  
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock  
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid  
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew’d,  
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform’d.  
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav’n  
Consum’d with nimble glance, and grateful steame;  
The others not, for his was not sincere;  
Whereat hee inlie rag’d, and as they talk’d,  
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone  
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale  
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus’d.  
Much at that sight was _Adam_ in his heart  
Dismai’d, and thus in haste to th’ Angel cri’d. </pre></div> </div>
