The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw  
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste  
The savour of Death from all things there that live:  
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest  
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.  

So saying, with delight he snuff’d the smell  
Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock  
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,  
Against the day of Battel, to a Field,  
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur’d  
With sent of living Carcasses design’d  
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.  
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn’d  
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,  
Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.  
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste </pre></div> </div>
