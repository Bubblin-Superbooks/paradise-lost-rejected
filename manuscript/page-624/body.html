Within himself unworthie Powers to reign  
Over free Reason, God in Judgement just  
Subjects him from without to violent Lords;  
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall  
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,  
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.  
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low  
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,  
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext  
Deprives them of thir outward libertie,  
Thir inward lost: Witness thâ€™ irreverent Son  
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame  
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,  
_Servant of Servants_, on his vitious Race.  
Thus will this latter, as the former World,  
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last  
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw </pre></div> </div>
