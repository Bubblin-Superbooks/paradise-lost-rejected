Thrice Fugitive about _Troy_ Wall; or rage  
Of _Turnus_ for _Lavinia_ disespous’d,  
Or _Neptun’s_ ire or _Juno’s_, that so long  
Perplex’d the _Greek_ and _Cytherea’s_ Son;  
If answerable style I can obtaine  
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes  
Her nightly visitation unimplor’d,  
And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires  
Easie my unpremeditated Verse:  
Since first this subject for Heroic Song  
Pleas’d me long choosing, and beginning late;  
Not sedulous by Nature to indite  
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument  
Heroic deem’d, chief maistrie to dissect  
With long and tedious havoc fabl’d Knights  
In Battels feign’d; the better fortitude  
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom </pre></div> </div>
