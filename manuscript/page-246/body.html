Each shoulder broad, came mantling o’re his brest  
With regal Ornament; the middle pair  
Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round  
Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold  
And colours dipt in Heav’n; the third his feet  
Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile  
Skie-tinctur’d grain. Like _Maia’s_ son he stood,  
And shook his Plumes, that Heav’nly fragrance filld  
The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands  
Of Angels under watch; and to his state,  
And to his message high in honour rise;  
For on som message high they guessd him bound.  
Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come  
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,  
And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;  
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here  
Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will </pre></div> </div>
