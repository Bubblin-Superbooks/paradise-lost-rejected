Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain,  
Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre  
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv’d  
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave  
Unworshipt, unobey’d the Throne supream  
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate  
Awak’ning, thus to him in secret spake.  

Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close  
Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree  
Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips  
Of Heav’ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts  
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;  
Both waking we were one; how then can now  
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos’d;  
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise  
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate </pre></div> </div>
