Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,  
Though wandring. He with his consorted _Eve_  
The storie heard attentive, and was fill’d  
With admiration, and deep Muse to heare  
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought  
So unimaginable as hate in Heav’n,  
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss  
With such confusion: but the evil soon  
Driv’n back redounded as a flood on those  
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix  
With Blessedness. Whence _Adam_ soon repeal’d  
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now  
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know  
What neerer might concern him, how this World  
Of Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,  
When, and whereof created, for what cause,  
What within _Eden_ or without was done </pre></div> </div>
