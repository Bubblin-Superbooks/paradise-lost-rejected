Our maker, and obey him whose command  
Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts  
Assur’d me and still assure: though what thou tellst  
Hath past in Heav’n, som doubt within me move,  
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,  
The full relation, which must needs be strange,  
Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;  
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun  
Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins  
His other half in the great Zone of Heav’n.  

Thus _Adam_ made request, and _Raphael_  
After short pause assenting, thus began.  

High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,  
Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate  
To human sense th’ invisible exploits </pre></div> </div>
