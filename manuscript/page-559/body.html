My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse;  
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold  
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care  
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands  
Cloath’d us unworthie, pitying while he judg’d;  
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear  
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,  
And teach us further by what means to shun  
Th’ inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,  
Which now the Skie with various Face begins  
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds  
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks  
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek  
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish  
Our Limbs benumm’d, ere this diurnal Starr  
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather’d beams  
Reflected, may with matter sere foment, </pre></div> </div>
