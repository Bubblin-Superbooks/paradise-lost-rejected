Plac’d Heav’n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,  
If it presume, might erre in things too high,  
And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun  
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs  
By his attractive vertue and thir own  
Incited, dance about him various rounds?  
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,  
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,  
In six thou seest, and what if sev’nth to these  
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,  
Insensibly three different Motions move?  
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,  
Mov’d contrarie with thwart obliquities,  
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift  
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos’d,  
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele  
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, </pre></div> </div>
