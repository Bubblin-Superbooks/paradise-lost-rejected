Our purer essence then will overcome  
Thir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,  
Or chang’d at length, and to the place conformd  
In temper and in nature, will receive  
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;  
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,  
Besides what hope the never-ending flight  
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change  
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers  
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,  
If we procure not to our selves more woe.  

Thus _Belial_ with words cloath’d in reasons garb  
Counsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,  
Not peace: and after him thus _Mammon_ spake.  

Either to disinthrone the King of Heav’n </pre></div> </div>
