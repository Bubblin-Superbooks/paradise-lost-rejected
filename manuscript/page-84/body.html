But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,  
And this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d  
With splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d  
And judg’d of public moment, in the shape  
Of difficulty or danger could deterre  
Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume  
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,  
Refusing to accept as great a share  
Of hazard as of honour, due alike  
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due  
Of hazard more, as he above the rest  
High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers,  
Terror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,  
While here shall be our home, what best may ease  
The present misery, and render Hell  
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm  
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain </pre></div> </div>
