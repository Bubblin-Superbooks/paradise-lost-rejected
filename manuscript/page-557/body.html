Of miserie, so thinking to evade  
The penaltie pronounc’t, doubt not but God  
Hath wiselier arm’d his vengeful ire then so  
To be forestall’d; much more I fear least Death  
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine  
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts  
Of contumacie will provoke the highest  
To make death in us live: Then let us seek  
Som safer resolution, which methinks  
I have in view, calling to minde with heed  
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise  
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless  
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe  
_Satan_, who in the Serpent hath contriv’d  
Against us this deceit: to crush his head  
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost  
By death brought on our selves, or childless days </pre></div> </div>
