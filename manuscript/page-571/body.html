Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each  
Had, like a double _Janus_, all thir shape  
Spangl’d with eyes more numerous then those  
Of _Argus_, and more wakeful then to drouze,  
Charm’d with _Arcadian_ Pipe, the Pastoral Reed  
Of _Hermes_, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile  
To resalute the World with sacred Light  
_Leucothea_ wak’d, and with fresh dews imbalmd  
The Earth, when _Adam_ and first Matron _Eve_  
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,  
Strength added from above, new hope to spring  
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;  
Which thus to _Eve_ his welcome words renewd.  

_Eve_, easily may Faith admit, that all  
The good which we enjoy, from Heav’n descends  
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav’n </pre></div> </div>
