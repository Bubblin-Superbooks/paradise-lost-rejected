In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they  
First seen in acts of prowess eminent  
And great exploits, but of true vertu void;  
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste  
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby  
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,  
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,  
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride  
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.  
The conquerd also, and enslav’d by Warr  
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose  
And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign’d  
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide  
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale  
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,  
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords  
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th’ Earth shall bear </pre></div> </div>
