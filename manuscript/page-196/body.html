Smil’d with superior Love, as _Jupiter_  
On _Juno_ smiles, when he impregns the Clouds  
That shed _May_ Flowers; and press’d her Matron lip  
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd  
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne  
Ey’d them askance, and to himself thus plaind.  

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two  
Imparadis’t in one anothers arms  
The happier _Eden_, shall enjoy thir fill  
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,  
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,  
Among our other torments not the least,  
Still unfulfill’d with pain of longing pines;  
Yet let me not forget what I have gain’d  
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:  
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call’d, </pre></div> </div>
