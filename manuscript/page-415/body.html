Yet one doubtPursues me still, least all I cannot die,Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of ManWhich God inspir’d, cannot together perishWith this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,Or in some other dismal place, who knowsBut I shall die a living Death? O thoughtHorrid, if true! yet why? it was but breathOf Life that sinn’d; what dies but what had lifeAnd sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.All of me then shall die: let this appeaseThe doubt, since humane reach no further knows.For though the Lord of all be infinite,Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,But mortal doom’d. How can he exerciseWrath without end on Man whom Death must end?Can he make deathless Death? that</p></div> </div>
