From me som Plume, that thy success may show  
Destruction to the rest: this pause between  
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;  
At first I thought that Libertie and Heav’n  
To heav’nly Soules had bin all one; but now  
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,  
Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;  
Such hast thou arm’d, the Minstrelsie of Heav’n,  
Servilitie with freedom to contend,  
As both thir deeds compar’d this day shall prove.  

To whom in brief thus _Abdiel_ stern repli’d.  
Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find  
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:  
Unjustly thou deprav’st it with the name  
Of _Servitude_ to serve whom God ordains,  
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, </pre></div> </div>
