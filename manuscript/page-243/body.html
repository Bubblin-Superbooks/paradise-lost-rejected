Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend  
Converse with _Adam_, in what Bowre or shade  
Thou find’st him from the heat of Noon retir’d,  
To respit his day-labour with repast,  
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,  
As may advise him of his happie state,  
Happiness in his power left free to will,  
Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,  
Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware  
He swerve not too secure: tell him withall  
His danger, and from whom, what enemie  
Late falln himself from Heav’n, is plotting now  
The fall of others from like state of bliss;  
By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,  
But by deceit and lies; this let him know,  
Least wilfully transgressing he pretend  
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. </pre></div> </div>
