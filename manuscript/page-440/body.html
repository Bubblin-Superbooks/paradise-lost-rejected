But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe  
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem  
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme  
Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns  
Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard  
By us? who rather double honour gaine  
From his surmise prov’d false, finde peace within,  
Favour from Heav’n, our witness from th’ event.  
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid  
Alone, without exterior help sustaind?  
Let us not then suspect our happie State  
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,  
As not secure to single or combin’d.  
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,  
And _Eden_ were no _Eden_ thus expos’d.  

To whom thus _Adam_ fervently repli’d. </pre></div> </div>
