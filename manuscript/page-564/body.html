Blow’n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd  
Dimentionless through Heav’nly dores; then clad  
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum’d,  
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight  
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son  
Presenting, thus to intercede began.  

See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung  
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs  
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt  
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,  
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed  
Sow’n with contrition in his heart, then those  
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees  
Of Paradise could have produc’t, ere fall’n  
From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare  
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; </pre></div> </div>
