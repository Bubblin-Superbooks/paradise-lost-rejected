And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more  
Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.  

His words here ended, but his meek aspect  
Silent yet spake, and breath’d immortal love  
To mortal men, above which only shon

Glad to be offer’d, he attends the will  
Of his great Father. Admiration seis’d  
All Heav’n, what this might mean, & whither tend  
Wondring; but soon th’ Almighty thus reply’d:  

O thou in Heav’n and Earth the only peace  
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou  
My sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear,  
To me are all my works, nor Man the least  
Though last created, that for him I spare </pre></div> </div>
