So prevalent as to concerne the mind  
Of God high blest, or to incline his will,  
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,  
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne  
Ev’n to the Seat of God. For since I saught  
By Prayer th’ offended Deitie to appease,  
Kneel’d and before him humbl’d all my heart,  
Methought I saw him placable and mild,  
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew  
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd  
Home to my brest, and to my memorie  
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;  
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now  
Assures me that the bitterness of death  
Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,  
_Eve_ rightly call’d, Mother of all Mankind,  
Mother of all things living, since by thee </pre></div> </div>
