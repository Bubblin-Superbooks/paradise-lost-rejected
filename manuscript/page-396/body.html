But who I was, or where, or from what cause,  
Knew not; to speak I tri’d, and forthwith spake,  
My Tongue obey’d and readily could name  
What e’re I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,  
And thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,  
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,  
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,  
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?  
Not of my self; by some great Maker then,  
In goodness and in power praeeminent;  
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,  
From whom I have that thus I move and live,  
And feel that I am happier then I know.  
While thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,  
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld  
This happie Light, when answer none return’d,  
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours </pre></div> </div>
