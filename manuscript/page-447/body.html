Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King  
Held dalliance with his faire _Egyptian_ Spouse.  
Much hee the Place admir’d, the Person more.  
As one who long in populous City pent,  
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,  
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe  
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes  
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,  
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,  
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;  
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,  
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,  
She most, and in her look summs all Delight.  
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold  
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of _Eve_  
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav’nly forme  
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, </pre></div> </div>
