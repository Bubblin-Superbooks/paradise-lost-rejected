If patiently thy bidding they obey,  
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale  
To _Adam_ what shall come in future dayes,  
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix  
My Cov’nant in the Womans seed renewd;  
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:  
And on the East side of the Garden place,  
Where entrance up from _Eden_ easiest climbes,  
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame  
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,  
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:  
Least Paradise a receptacle prove  
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,  
With whose stol’n Fruit Man once more to delude.  

He ceas’d; and th’ Archangelic Power prepar’d  
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright </pre></div> </div>
