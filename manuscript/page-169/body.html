How due! yet all his good prov’d ill in me,  
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high  
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher  
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit  
The debt immense of endless gratitude,  
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;  
Forgetful what from him I still receivd,  
And understood not that a grateful mind  
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once  
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?  
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind  
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood  
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais’d  
Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power  
As great might have aspir’d, and me though mean  
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great  
Fell not, but stand unshak’n, from within </pre></div> </div>
