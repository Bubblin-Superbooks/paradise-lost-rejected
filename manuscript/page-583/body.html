Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;  
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree  
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice  
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk’d:  
So many grateful Altars I would reare  
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone  
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,  
Or monument to Ages, and thereon  
Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:  
In yonder nether World where shall I seek  
His bright appearances, or footstep trace?  
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall’d  
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now  
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts  
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.  

To whom thus _Michael_ with regard benigne. </pre></div> </div>
