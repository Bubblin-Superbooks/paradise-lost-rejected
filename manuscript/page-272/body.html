Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,  
That the most High commanding, now ere Night,  
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav’n,  
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;  
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between  
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound  
Or taint integritie; but all obey’d  
The wonted signal, and superior voice  
Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed  
His name, and high was his degree in Heav’n;  
His count’nance, as the Morning Starr that guides  
The starrie flock, allur’d them, and with lyes  
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Host:  
Mean while th’ Eternal eye, whose sight discernes  
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount  
And from within the golden Lamps that burne  
Nightly before him, saw without thir light </pre></div> </div>
