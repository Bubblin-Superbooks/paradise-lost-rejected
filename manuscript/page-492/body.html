Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:  
And am I now upbraided, as the cause  
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,  
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?  
I warn’d thee, I admonish’d thee, foretold  
The danger, and the lurking Enemie  
That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,  
And force upon free Will hath here no place.  
But confidence then bore thee on, secure  
Either to meet no danger, or to finde  
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps  
I also err’d in overmuch admiring  
What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought  
No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue  
That errour now, which is become my crime,  
And thou th’ accuser. Thus it shall befall  
Him who to worth in Women overtrusting </pre></div> </div>
