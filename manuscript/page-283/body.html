Encompass’d round with foes, thus answerd bold.  

O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,  
Forsak’n of all good; I see thy fall  
Determind, and thy hapless crew involv’d  
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred  
Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth  
No more be troubl’d how to quit the yoke  
Of Gods _Messiah_; those indulgent Laws  
Will not be now voutsaf’t, other Decrees  
Against thee are gon forth without recall;  
That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject  
Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake  
Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise,  
Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly  
These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth  
Impendent, raging into sudden flame </pre></div> </div>
