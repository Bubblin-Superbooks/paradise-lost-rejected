A Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees  
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw  
Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree  
Load’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye  
Tempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite  
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found  
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream  
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun  
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide  
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,  
Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw  
In adoration at his feet I fell  
Submiss: he rear’d me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,  
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest  
Above, or round about thee or beneath.  
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine  
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: </pre></div> </div>
