Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake  
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:  
Then commune how that day they best may ply  
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew  
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.  
And _Eve_ first to her Husband thus began.  

_Adam_, well may we labour still to dress  
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.  
Our pleasant task enjoynâ€™d, but till more hands  
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,  
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day  
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,  
One night or two with wanton growth derides  
Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise  
Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,  
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice </pre></div> </div>
