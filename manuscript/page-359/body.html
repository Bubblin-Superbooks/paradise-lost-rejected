In the day we eateOf this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,Irrational till then. For us aloneWas death invented? or to us deni’dThis intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which firstHath tasted, envies not, but brings with joyThe good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.What fear I then, rather what know to feareUnder this ignorance of Good and Evil,Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,Of vertue to make wise: what hinders thenTo reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So saying, her rash hand in evil hourForth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seatSighing through all her Works</p></div> </div>
