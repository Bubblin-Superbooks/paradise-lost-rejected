As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;  
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,  
For haste; such flight the great command impress’d  
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call  
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)  
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,  
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,  
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,  
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,  
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide  
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,  
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;  
Easie, e’re God had bid the ground be drie,  
All but within those banks, where Rivers now  
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.  
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle  
Of congregated Waters he call’d Seas: </pre></div> </div>
