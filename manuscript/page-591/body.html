O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall’n  
To that meek man, who well had sacrific’d;  
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?  

T’ whom _Michael_ thus, hee also mov’d, repli’d.  
These two are Brethren, _Adam_, and to come  
Out of thy loyns; th’ unjust the just hath slain,  
For envie that his Brothers Offering found  
From Heav’n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact  
Will be aveng’d, and th’ others Faith approv’d  
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,  
Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire.  

Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!  
But have I now seen Death? Is this the way  
I must return to native dust? O sight </pre></div> </div>
