And horrors hast thou driv’n me; out of which  
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung’d!  

Thus _Adam_ to himself lamented loud  
Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,  
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air  
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,  
Which to his evil Conscience represented  
All things with double terror: On the ground  
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft  
Curs’d his Creation, Death as oft accus’d  
Of tardie execution, since denounc’t  
The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,  
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke  
To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,  
Justice Divine not hast’n to be just?  
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine </pre></div> </div>
