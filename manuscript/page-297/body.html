Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge  
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee  
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth  
Winds under ground or waters forcing way  
Sidelong, had push’t a Mountain from his seat  
Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis’d  
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see  
Thus foil’d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,  
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire  
Of Battel: whereat _Michael_ bid sound  
Th’ Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav’n  
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung  
_Hosanna_ to the Highest: nor stood at gaze  
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn’d  
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,  
And clamour such as heard in Heav’n till now  
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray’d </pre></div> </div>
