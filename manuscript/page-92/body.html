Heard on the ruful stream; fierce _Phlegeton_  
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.  
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,  
_Lethe_ the River of Oblivion roules  
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,  
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,  
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.  
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent  
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms  
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land  
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems  
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,  
A gulf profound as that _Serbonian_ Bog  
Betwixt _Damiata_ and mount _Casius_ old,  
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air  
Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire.  
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d, </pre></div> </div>
