So _Jove_ usurping reign’d: these first in _Creet_  
And _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top  
Of cold _Olympus_ rul’d the middle Air  
Thir highest Heav’n; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff,  
Or in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds  
Of _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old  
Fled over _Adria_ to th’ _Hesperian_ Fields,  
And ore the _Celtic_ roam’d the utmost Isles.  
All these and more came flocking; but with looks  
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d  
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief  
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost  
In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast  
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride  
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore  
Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d  
Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears. </pre></div> </div>
