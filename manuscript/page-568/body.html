In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light  
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,  
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream  
Th’ Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.  

O Sons, like one of us Man is become  
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste  
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast  
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,  
Happier, had it suffic’d him to have known  
Good by it self, and Evil not at all.  
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,  
My motions in him, longer then they move,  
His heart I know, how variable and vain  
Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand  
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,  
And live for ever, dream at least to live </pre></div> </div>
