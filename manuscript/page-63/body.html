Then miserable to have eternal being:  
Or if our substance be indeed Divine,  
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst  
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel  
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,  
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,  
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:  
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.

Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous  
To less then Gods. On th’ other side up rose  
_Belial_, in act more graceful and humane;  
A fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd  
For dignity compos’d and high exploit:  
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue  
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear </pre></div> </div>
