Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,  
Then cavil the conditions? and though God  
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son  
Prove disobedient, and reprov’d, retort,  
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:  
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee  
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,  
But Natural necessity begot.  
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own  
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,  
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.  
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,  
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:  
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes  
His hand to execute what his Decree  
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,  
Why am I mockt with death, and length’nd out </pre></div> </div>
