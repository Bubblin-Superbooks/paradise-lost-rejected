Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,  
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.  
Him through the spicie Forrest onward com  
_Adam_ discernd, as in the dore he sat  
Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun  
Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme  
Earths inmost womb, more warmth then _Adam_ need;  
And _Eve_ within, due at her hour prepar’d  
For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please  
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst  
Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,  
Berrie or Grape: to whom thus _Adam_ call’d.  

Haste hither _Eve_, and worth thy sight behold  
Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape  
Comes this way moving; seems another Morn </pre></div> </div>
