With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us’d  
To sit indulgent, and with him partake  
Rural repast, permitting him the while  
Venial discourse unblam’d: I now must change  
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach  
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt  
And disobedience: On the part of Heav’n  
Now alienated, distance and distaste,  
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv’n,  
That brought into this World a world of woe,  
Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie  
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument  
Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth  
Of stern _Achilles_ on his Foe pursu’d </pre></div> </div>
