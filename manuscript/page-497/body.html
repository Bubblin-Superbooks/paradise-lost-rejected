On his transgression, Death denounc’t that day,  
Which he presumes already vain and void,  
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear’d,  
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find  
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.  
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn’d.  
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee  
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr’d  
All Judgement, whether in Heav’n, or Earth; or Hell.  
Easie it may be seen that I intend  
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee  
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design’d  
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,  
And destin’d Man himself to judge Man fall’n.  

So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright  
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son </pre></div> </div>
