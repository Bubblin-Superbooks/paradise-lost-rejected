Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,  
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain  
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,  
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds  
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:  
Warr he perceav’d, warr in procinct, and found  
Already known what he for news had thought  
To have reported: gladly then he mixt  
Among those friendly Powers who him receav’d  
With joy and acclamations loud, that one  
That of so many Myriads fall’n, yet one  
Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill  
They led him high applauded, and present  
Before the seat supream; from whence a voice  
From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.  

Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought </pre></div> </div>
