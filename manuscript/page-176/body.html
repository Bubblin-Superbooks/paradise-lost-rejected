So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend  
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas’d  
Then _Asmodeus_ with the fishie fume,  
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse  
Of _Tobits_ Son, and with a vengeance sent  
From _Media_ post to _Aegypt_, there fast bound.  

Now to th’ ascent of that steep savage Hill  
_Satan_ had journied on, pensive and slow;  
But further way found none, so thick entwin’d,  
As one continu’d brake, the undergrowth  
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext  
All path of Man or Beast that past that way:  
One Gate there onely was, and that look’d East  
On th’ other side: which when th’ arch-fellon saw  
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,  
At one slight bound high overleap’d all bound </pre></div> </div>
