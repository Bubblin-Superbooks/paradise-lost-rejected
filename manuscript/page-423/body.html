Of _Hesperus_, whose Office is to bring  
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter  
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end  
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:  
When _Satan_ who late fled before the threats  
Of _Gabriel_ out of _Eden_, now improv’d  
In meditated fraud and malice, bent  
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap  
Of heavier on himself, fearless return’d.  
By Night he fled, and at Midnight return’d  
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,  
Since _Uriel_ Regent of the Sun descri’d  
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim  
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv’n,  
The space of seven continu’d Nights he rode  
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line  
He circl’d, four times cross’d the Carr of Night </pre></div> </div>
