Not that they durst without his leave attempt,  
But us he sends upon his high behests  
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure  
Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut  
The dismal Gates, and barricado’d strong;  
But long ere our approaching heard within  
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,  
Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.  
Glad we return’d up to the coasts of Light  
Ere Sabbath Eev’ning: so we had in charge.  
But thy relation now; for I attend,  
Pleas’d with thy words no less then thou with mine.  

So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.  
For Man to tell how human Life began  
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?  
Desire with thee still longer to converse </pre></div> </div>
