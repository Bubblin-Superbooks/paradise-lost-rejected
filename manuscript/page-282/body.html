Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais’d  
By our own quick’ning power, when fatal course

These tidings carrie to th’ anointed King;  
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.

Hoarce murmur echo’d to his words applause  
Through the infinite Host, nor less for that  
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone </pre></div> </div>
