The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,  
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,  
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd  
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each  
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all  
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels  
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;  
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,  
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure  
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.  
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd  
Of radiant _Urim_, work divinely wrought,  
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie  
Sate Eagle-wing’d, beside him hung his Bow  
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor’d,  
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld </pre></div> </div>
