The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre  
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground  
Walk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds  
The silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine  
Adorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue  
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus  
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,  
Ev’ning and Morn solemniz’d the Fift day.

Let th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,  
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,  
Each in their kinde. The Earth obey’d, and strait  
Op’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth  
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,  
Limb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose </pre></div> </div>
