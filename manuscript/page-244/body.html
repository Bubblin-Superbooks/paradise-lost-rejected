On each hand parting, to his speed gave way  
Through all th’ Empyreal road; till at the Gate  
Of Heav’n arriv’d, the gate self-opend wide  
On golden Hinges turning, as by work  
Divine the sov’ran Architect had fram’d.  
From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,  
Starr interpos’d, however small he sees,  
Not unconform to other shining Globes,  
Earth and the Gard’n of God, with Cedars crownd  
Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass </pre></div> </div>
