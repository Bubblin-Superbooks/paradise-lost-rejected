His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay  
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.  
The rest is true, they found me where they say;  
But that implies not violence or harme.  

Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov’d,  
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli’d.  
O loss of one in Heav’n to judge of wise,  
Since _Satan_ fell, whom follie overthrew,  
And now returns him from his prison scap’t,  
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise  
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither  
Unlicenc’t from his bounds in Hell prescrib’d;  
So wise he judges it to fly from pain  
However, and to scape his punishment.  
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,  
Which thou incurr’st by flying, meet thy flight </pre></div> </div>
