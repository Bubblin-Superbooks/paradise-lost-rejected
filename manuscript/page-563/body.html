Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above  
Prevenient Grace descending had remov’d  
The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh  
Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath’d  
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer  
Inspir’d, and wing’d for Heav’n with speedier flight  
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port  
Not of mean suiters, nor important less  
Seem’d thir Petition, then when th’ ancient Pair  
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,  
_Deucalion_ and chaste _Pyrrha_ to restore  
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine  
Of _Themis_ stood devout. To Heav’n thir prayers  
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes </pre></div> </div>
