Establisht, such delight hath God in Men  
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes  
Among them to set up his Tabernacle,  
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:  
By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram’d  
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein  
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,  
The Records of his Cov’nant, over these  
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings  
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn  
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing  
The Heav’nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud  
Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,  
Save when they journie, and at length they come,  
Conducted by his Angel to the Land  
Promisd to _Abraham_ and his Seed: the rest  
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, </pre></div> </div>
