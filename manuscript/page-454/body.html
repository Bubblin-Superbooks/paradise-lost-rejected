To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day  
Created mute to all articulat sound;  
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks  
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.  
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field  
I knew, but not with human voice endu’d;  
Redouble then this miracle, and say,  
How cam’st thou speakable of mute, and how  
To me so friendly grown above the rest  
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?  
Say, for such wonder claims attention due.  

To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply’d.  
Empress of this fair World, resplendent _Eve_,  
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all  
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: </pre></div> </div>
