Mov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee;  
But hee once past, soon after when man fell,  
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain  
Following his track, such was the will of Heav’n,  
Pav’d after him a broad and beat’n way  
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf  
Tamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length  
From Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe  
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse  
With easie intercourse pass to and fro  
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom  
God and good Angels guard by special grace.  
But now at last the sacred influence  
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n  
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night  
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins  
Her fardest verge, and _Chaos_ to retire </pre></div> </div>
