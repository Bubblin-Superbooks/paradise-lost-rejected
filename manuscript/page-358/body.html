The Earth was form’d, but in the Womb as yet  
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv’d,  
Appeer’d not: over all the face of Earth  
Main Ocean flow’d, not idle, but with warme  
Prolific humour soft’ning all her Globe,  
Fermented the great Mother to conceave,  
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said  
Be gather’d now ye Waters under Heav’n  
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.  
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer  
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave  
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:  
So high as heav’d the tumid Hills, so low  
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,  
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they  
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld </pre></div> </div>
