Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain’d  
This answer from the gratious voice Divine.  

Thus farr to try thee, _Adam_, I was pleas’d,  
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,  
Which thou hast rightly nam’d, but of thy self,  
Expressing well the spirit within thee free,  
My Image, not imparted to the Brute,  
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee  
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,  
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak’st,  
Knew it not good for Man to be alone,  
And no such companie as then thou saw’st  
Intended thee, for trial onely brought,  
To see how thou could’st judge of fit and meet:  
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur’d,  
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, </pre></div> </div>
