And banisht from mans life his happiest life,  
Simplicitie and spotless innocence.  
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight  
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:  
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair  
That ever since in loves imbraces met,  
_Adam_ the goodliest man of men since borne  
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters _Eve_.  
Under a tuft of shade that on a green  
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side  
They sat them down, and after no more toil  
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then sufficâ€™d  
To recommend coole _Zephyr_, and made ease  
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite  
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,  
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes  
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline </pre></div> </div>
