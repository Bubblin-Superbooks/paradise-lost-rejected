Of happiness and final misery,  
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,  
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:  
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm  
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite  
Fallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest  
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.  
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,  
On bold adventure to discover wide  
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps  
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend  
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks  
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge  
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;  
Abhorred _Styx_ the flood of deadly hate,  
Sad _Acheron_ of sorrow, black and deep;  
_Cocytus_, nam’d of lamentation loud </pre></div> </div>
