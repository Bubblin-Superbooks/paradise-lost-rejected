To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more  
Then Heav’n permits, nor mine, though doubld now  
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,  
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign  
Where thou art weigh’d, & shown how light, how weak,  
If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew  
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled  
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
