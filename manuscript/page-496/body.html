Amidst in Thunder utter’d thus his voice.  

Assembl’d Angels, and ye Powers return’d  
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,  
Nor troubl’d at these tidings from the Earth,  
Which your sincerest care could not prevent,  
Foretold so lately what would come to pass,  
When first this Tempter cross’d the Gulf from Hell.  
I told ye then he should prevail and speed  
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc’t  
And flatter’d out of all, believing lies  
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine  
Concurring to necessitate his Fall,  
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse  
His free Will, to her own inclining left  
In eevn scale. But fall’n he is, and now  
What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass </pre></div> </div>
