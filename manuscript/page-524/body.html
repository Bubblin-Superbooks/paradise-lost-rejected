Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful  
Of absolute perfection, therein Man  
Plac’t in a Paradise, by our exile  
Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc’d  
From his Creator, and the more to increase  
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat  
Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv’n up  
Both his beloved Man and all his World,  
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,  
Without our hazard, labour or allarme,  
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man  
To rule, as over all he should have rul’d.  
True is, mee also he hath judg’d, or rather  
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape  
Man I deceav’d: that which to mee belongs,  
Is enmity, which he will put between  
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; </pre></div> </div>
