Milde, as when _Zephyrus_ on _Flora_ breathes,  
Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake  
My fairest, my espous’d, my latest found,  
Heav’ns last best gift, my ever new delight,  
Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field  
Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring  
Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,  
What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed,  
How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee  
Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.  

Such whispering wak’d her, but with startl’d eye  
On _Adam_, whom imbracing, thus she spake.  

O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,  
My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see  
Thy face, and Morn return’d, for I this Night, </pre></div> </div>
