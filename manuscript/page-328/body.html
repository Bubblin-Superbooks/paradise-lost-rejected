Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou  
Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace  
Immense I have transfus’d, that all may know  
In Heav’n and Hell thy Power above compare,  
And this perverse Commotion governd thus,  
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir  
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King  
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.  
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,  
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles  
That shake Heav’ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,  
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms  
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;  
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out  
From all Heav’ns bounds into the utter Deep:  
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise  
God and _Messiah_ his anointed King. </pre></div> </div>
