Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?  
What when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook  
With Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought  
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d  
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay  
Chain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.  
What if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires  
Awak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage  
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above  
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again  
His red right hand to plague us? what if all  
Her stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament  
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,  
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall  
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps  
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,  
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d </pre></div> </div>
