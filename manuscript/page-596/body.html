There is, said _Michael_, if thou well observe  
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught  
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence  
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,  
Till many years over thy head return:  
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop  
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease  
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:  
This is old age; but then thou must outlive  
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change  
To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then  
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,  
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth  
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne  
A melancholly damp of cold and dry  
To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume </pre></div> </div>
