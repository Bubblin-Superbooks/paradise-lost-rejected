Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,  
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,  
Whose Bed is undefil’d and chast pronounc’t,  
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us’d.  
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights  
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,  
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile  
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,  
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours  
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,  
Or Serenate, which the starv’d Lover sings  
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.  
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,  
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof  
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair’d. Sleep on,  
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek  
No happier state, and know to know no more. </pre></div> </div>
