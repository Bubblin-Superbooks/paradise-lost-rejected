Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,  
And after him, the surer messenger,  
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie  
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;  
The second time returning, in his Bill  
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:  
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke  
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;  
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,  
Grateful to Heav’n, over his head beholds  
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow  
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,  
Betok’ning peace from God, and Cov’nant new.  
Whereat the heart of _Adam_ erst so sad  
Greatly rejoyc’d, and thus his joy broke forth.  

O thou that future things canst represent </pre></div> </div>
