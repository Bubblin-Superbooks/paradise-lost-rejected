(Such are the Courts of God) Th’ Angelic throng  
Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend  
By living Streams among the Trees of Life,  
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,  
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept  
Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course  
Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne  
Alternate all night long: but not so wak’d  
_Satan_, so call him now, his former name  
Is heard no more Heav’n; he of the first,  
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,  
In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught  
With envie against the Son of God, that day  
Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd  
_Messiah_ King anointed, could not beare  
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. </pre></div> </div>
