Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,  
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles  
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract  
His troubl’d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr  
The Hell within him, for within him Hell  
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell  
One step no more then from himself can fly  
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair  
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie  
Of what he was, what is, and what must be  
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.  
Sometimes towards _Eden_ which now in his view  
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,  
Sometimes towards Heav’n and the full-blazing Sun,  
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:  
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. </pre></div> </div>
