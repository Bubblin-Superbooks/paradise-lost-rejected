Griev’d at his heart, when looking down he saw  
The whole Earth fill’d with violence, and all flesh  
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov’d,  
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,  
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,  
And makes a Covenant never to destroy  
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea  
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World  
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings  
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set  
His triple-colour’d Bow, whereon to look  
And call to mind his Cov’nant: Day and Night,  
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost  
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,  
Both Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.  
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;  
And Man as from a second stock proceed. </pre></div> </div>
