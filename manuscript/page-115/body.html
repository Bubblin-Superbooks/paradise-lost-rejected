Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask  
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes  
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne  
Of _Chaos_, and his dark Pavilion spread  
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d  
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,  
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood  
_Orcus_ and _Ades_, and the dreaded name  
Of _Demogorgon_; Rumor next and Chance,  
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,  
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.  

T’ whom _Satan_ turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers  
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,  
_Chaos_ and _Ancient Night_, I come no Spie,  
With purpose to explore or to disturb  
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint </pre></div> </div>
