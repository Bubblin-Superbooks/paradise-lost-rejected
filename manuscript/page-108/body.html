Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen  
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d  
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d  
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.  
He ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death  
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear  
His famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe  
Destin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d  
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.  

The key of this infernal Pit by due,  
And by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King  
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock  
These Adamantine Gates; against all force  
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,  
Fearless to be o’rematcht by living might.  
But what ow I to his commands above </pre></div> </div>
