Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd  
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,  
Deign to descend now lower, and relate  
What may no less perhaps availe us known,  
How first began this Heav’n which we behold  
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd  
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills  
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus’d  
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause  
Mov’d the Creator in his holy Rest  
Through all Eternitie so late to build  
In _Chaos_, and the work begun, how soon  
Absolv’d, if unforbid thou maist unfould  
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske  
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more  
To magnifie his works, the more we know.  
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run </pre></div> </div>
