To whom the warriour Angel soon repli’d.  
To say and strait unsay, pretending first  
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,  
Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac’t,  
_Satan_, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,  
O sacred name of faithfulness profan’d!  
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?  
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;  
Was this your discipline and faith ingag’d,  
Your military obedience, to dissolve  
Allegeance to th’ acknowledg’d Power supream?  
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem  
Patron of liberty, who more then thou  
Once fawn’d, and cring’d, and servilly ador’d  
Heav’ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope  
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? </pre></div> </div>
