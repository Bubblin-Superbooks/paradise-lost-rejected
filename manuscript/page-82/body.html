Of Angels watching round? Here he had need  
All circumspection, and we now no less  
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,  
The weight of all and our last hope relies.  

This said, he sat; and expectation held

To second, or oppose, or undertake  
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,  
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each

Of those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found  
So hardie as to proffer or accept  
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last  
_Satan_, whom now transcendent glory rais’d  
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride </pre></div> </div>
