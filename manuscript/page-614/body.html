No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast  
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg’d,  
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts  
Of Heav’n set open on the Earth shall powre  
Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep  
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp  
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise  
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount  
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd  
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,  
With all his verdure spoil’d, and Trees adrift  
Down the great River to the op’ning Gulf,  
And there take root an Iland salt and bare,  
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.  
To teach thee that God attributes to place  
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought  
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. </pre></div> </div>
