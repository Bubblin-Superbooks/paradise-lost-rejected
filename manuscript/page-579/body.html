And one bad act with many deeds well done  
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas’d  
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;  
But longer in this Paradise to dwell  
Permits not; to remove thee I am come,  
And send thee from the Garden forth to till  
The ground whence thou wast tak’n, fitter Soile.  

He added not, for _Adam_ at the newes  
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,  
That all his senses bound; _Eve_, who unseen  
Yet all had heard, with audible lament  
Discover’d soon the place of her retire.  

O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!  
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave  
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, </pre></div> </div>
