Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice  
More hard’nd after thaw, till in his rage  
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea  
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass  
As on drie land between two christal walls,  
Aw’d by the rod of _Moses_ so to stand  
Divided, till his rescu’d gain thir shoar:  
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,  
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe  
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,  
To guide them in thir journey, and remove  
Behinde them, while th’ obdurat King pursues:  
All night he will pursue, but his approach  
Darkness defends between till morning Watch;  
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud  
God looking forth will trouble all his Host  
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command </pre></div> </div>
