Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,  
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav’n  
To thir own vile advantages shall turne  
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth  
With superstitions and traditions taint,  
Left onely in those written Records pure,  
Though not but by the Spirit understood.  
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,  
Places and titles, and with these to joine  
Secular power, though feigning still to act  
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating  
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv’n  
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,  
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force  
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde  
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within  
Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then </pre></div> </div>
