Detain from following thy illustrious track.  
Thou hast atchiev’d our libertie, confin’d  
Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow’rd  
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay  
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.  
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won  
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain’d  
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng’d  
Our foile in Heav’n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,  
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,  
As Battel hath adjudg’d, from this new World  
Retiring, by his own doom alienated,  
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide  
Of all things, parted by th’ Empyreal bounds,  
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,  
Or trie thee now more dang’rous to his Throne. </pre></div> </div>
