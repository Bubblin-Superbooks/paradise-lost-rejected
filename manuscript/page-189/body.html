Not like these narrow limits, to receive  
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,  
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge  
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.  
And should I at your harmless innocence  
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,  
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg’d,  
By conquering this new World, compels me now  
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.  

So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,  
The Tyrants plea, excus’d his devilish deeds.  
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree  
Down he alights among the sportful Herd  
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,  
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end  
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi’d </pre></div> </div>
