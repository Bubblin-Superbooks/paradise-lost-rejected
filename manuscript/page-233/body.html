He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil’d  
At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:  
But he thus overjoy’d, O Fruit Divine,  
Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,  
Forbidd’n here, it seems, as onely fit  
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:  
And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more  
Communicated, more abundant growes,  
The Author not impair’d, but honourd more?  
Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic _Eve_,  
Partake thou also; happie though thou art,  
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:  
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods  
Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,  
But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes  
Ascend to Heav’n, by merit thine, and see  
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. </pre></div> </div>
