How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,  
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,  
Irrational till then. For us alone  
Was death invented? or to us deni’d  
This intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?  
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first  
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy  
The good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,  
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.  
What fear I then, rather what know to feare  
Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,  
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?  
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,  
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,  
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then  
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? </pre></div> </div>
