Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d  
In secret, riding through the Air she comes  
Lur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance  
With _Lapland_ Witches, while the labouring Moon  
Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape,  
If shape it might be call’d that shape had none  
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,  
Or substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,  
For each seem’d either; black it stood as Night,  
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,  
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head  
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.  
_Satan_ was now at hand, and from his seat  
The Monster moving onward came as fast,  
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.  
Th’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,  
Admir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except, </pre></div> </div>
