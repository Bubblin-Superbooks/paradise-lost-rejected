To Satan first in sin his doom apply’d,  
Though in mysterious terms, judg’d as then best:  
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.  

Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst  
Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;  
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,  
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.  
Between Thee and the Woman I will put  
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;  
Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.  

So spake this Oracle, then verifi’d  
When _Jesus_ son of _Mary_ second _Eve_,  
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav’n,  
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave  
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht </pre></div> </div>
