Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas’d.  
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire  
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.  

O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,  
Thy Trophies, which thou view’st as not thine own,  
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:  
For I no sooner in my Heart divin’d,  
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie  
Still moves with thine, joyn’d in connexion sweet,  
That thou on Earth hadst prosper’d, which thy looks  
Now also evidence, but straight I felt  
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt  
That I must after thee with this thy Son;  
Such fatal consequence unites us three:  
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,  
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure </pre></div> </div>
