Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array  
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move  
In perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood  
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d  
To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old  
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage  
Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d  
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,  
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage  
With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase  
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain  
From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they  
Breathing united force with fixed thought  
Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d  
Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now  
Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front  
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise </pre></div> </div>
