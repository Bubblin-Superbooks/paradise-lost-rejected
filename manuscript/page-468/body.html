So saying, her rash hand in evil hour  
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:  
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat  
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,  
That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk  
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for _Eve_  
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else  
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,  
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true  
Or fansied so, through expectation high  
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.  
Greedily she ingorg’d without restraint,  
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,  
And hight’nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,  
Thus to her self she pleasingly began. </pre></div> </div>
