And growing up to Godhead; which for thee  
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.  
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,  
Tedious, unshar’d with thee, and odious soon.  
Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot  
May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;  
Least thou not tasting, different degree  
Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce  
Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.  

Thus _Eve_ with Countnance blithe her storie told;  
But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.  
On th’ other side, _Adam_, soon as he heard  
The fatal Trespass don by _Eve_, amaz’d,  
Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill  
Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax’d;  
From his slack hand the Garland wreath’d for _Eve_ </pre></div> </div>
