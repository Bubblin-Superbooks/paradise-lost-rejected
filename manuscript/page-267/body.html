Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place  
Ordaind without redemption, without end.  

So spake th’ Omnipotent, and with his words  
All seemd well pleas’d, all seem’d, but were not all.  
That day, as other solem dayes, they spent  
In song and dance about the sacred Hill,  
Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare  
Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles  
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,  
Eccentric, intervolv’d, yet regular  
Then most, when most irregular they seem:  
And in thir motions harmonie Divine  
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear  
Listens delighted. Eevning approachd  
(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,  
We ours for change delectable, not need) </pre></div> </div>
