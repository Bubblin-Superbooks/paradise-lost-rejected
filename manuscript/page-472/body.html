Solace in her return, so long delay’d;  
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,  
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;  
And forth to meet her went, the way she took  
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree  
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,  
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand  
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil’d,  
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus’d.  
To him she hasted, in her face excuse  
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,  
Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.  

Hast thou not wonderd, _Adam_, at my stay?  
Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv’d  
Thy presence, agonie of love till now  
Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more </pre></div> </div>
