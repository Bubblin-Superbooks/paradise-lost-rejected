Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd  
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.  
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,  
Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;  
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind  
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.  
He ended, and his words thir drooping chere  
Enlightn’d, and thir languisht hope reviv’d.  
Th’ invention all admir’d, and each, how hee  
To be th’ inventer miss’d, so easie it seemd  
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought  
Impossible: yet haply of thy Race  
In future dayes, if Malice should abound,  
Some one intent on mischief, or inspir’d  
With dev’lish machination might devise  
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men </pre></div> </div>
