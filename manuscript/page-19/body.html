Our labour must be to pervert that end,  
And out of good still to find means of evil;  
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps  
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb  
His inmost counsels from their destind aim.  
But see the angry Victor hath recall’d  
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit  
Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail  
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid  
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice  
Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,  
Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,  
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now  
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.  
Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,  
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.  
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, </pre></div> </div>
