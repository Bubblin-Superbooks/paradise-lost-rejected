Th’ attempt it self, intended by our Foe.  
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses  
The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos’d  
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff  
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne  
And anger wouldst resent the offer’d wrong,  
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,  
If such affront I labour to avert  
From thee alone, which on us both at once  
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,  
Or daring, first on mee th’ assault shall light.  
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;  
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce  
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.  
I from the influence of thy looks receave  
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight  
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were </pre></div> </div>
