Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,  
With tufts the vallies & each fountain side,  
With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now  
Seemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,  
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt  
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d  
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground  
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist  
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each  
Plant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth  
God made, and every Herb, before it grew  
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:  
So Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.  

Again th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights  
High in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide </pre></div> </div>
