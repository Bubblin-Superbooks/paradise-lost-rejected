O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,  
Against thy only Son? What fury O Son,  
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart  
Against thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom;  
For him who sits above and laughs the while  
At thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute  
What e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,  
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.  

She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest  
Forbore, then these to her _Satan_ return’d:  

So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange  
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand  
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds  
What it intends; till first I know of thee, </pre></div> </div>
