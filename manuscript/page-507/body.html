Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;  
Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth  
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th’ Herb of th’ Field,  
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,  
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou  
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,  
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.  

 So judg’d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,  
And th’ instant stroke of Death denounc’t that day  
Remov’d farr off; then pittying how they stood  
Before him naked to the aire, that now  
Must suffer change, disdain’d not to begin  
Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,  
As when he wash’d his servants feet, so now  
As Father of his Familie he clad  
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, </pre></div> </div>
