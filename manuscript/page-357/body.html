Again, God said, let ther be Firmament  
Amid the Waters, and let it divide  
The Waters from the Waters: and God made  
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,  
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus’d  
In circuit to the uttermost convex  
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,  
The Waters underneath from those above  
Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World  
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide  
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule  
Of _Chaos_ farr remov’d, least fierce extreames  
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:  
And Heav’n he nam’d the Firmament: So Eev’n  
And Morning _Chorus_ sung the second Day. </pre></div> </div>
