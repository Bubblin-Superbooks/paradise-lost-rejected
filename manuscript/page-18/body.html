That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,  
Or do him mightier service as his thralls  
By right of Warr, what e’re his business be  
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,  
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;  
What can it then avail though yet we feel  
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being  
To undergo eternal punishment?  
Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.  

Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable  
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,  
To do ought good never will be our task,  
But ever to do ill our sole delight,  
As being the contrary to his high will  
Whom we resist. If then his Providence  
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, </pre></div> </div>
