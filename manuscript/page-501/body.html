Or to each other, but apparent guilt,  
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,  
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.  
Whence _Adam_ faultring long, thus answer’d brief.  

I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice  
Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom  
The gracious Judge without revile repli’d.  

My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear’d,  
But still rejoyc’t, how is it now become  
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who  
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree  
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?  

To whom thus _Adam_ sore beset repli’d.  
O Heav’n! in evil strait this day I stand </pre></div> </div>
