His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,  
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth  
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on  
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night  
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,  
And these the Gemms of Heav’n, her starrie train:  
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends  
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun  
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,  
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,  
Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night  
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,  
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.  
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom  
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?  

To whom our general Ancestor repli’d. </pre></div> </div>
