Ris’n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav’n  
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe  
This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed,  
And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure  
Abundance, fit to honour and receive  
Our Heav’nly stranger; well we may afford  
Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow  
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies  
Her fertil growth, and by disburd’ning grows  
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.  

To whom thus _Eve_. _Adam_, earths hallowd mould,  
Of God inspir’d, small store will serve, where store,  
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;  
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains  
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: </pre></div> </div>
