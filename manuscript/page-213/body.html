Now had night measur’d with her shaddowie Cone  
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,  
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim  
Forth issuing at th’ accustomd hour stood armd  
To thir night watches in warlike Parade,  
When _Gabriel_ to his next in power thus spake.  

_Uzziel_, half these draw off, and coast the South  
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,  
Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part  
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.  
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld  
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.  

_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_, with wingd speed  
Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook, </pre></div> </div>
