Stood rankt of Seraphim another row  
In posture to displode thir second tire  
Of Thunder: back defeated to return  
They worse abhorr’d. _Satan_ beheld thir plight,  
And to his Mates thus in derision call’d.  

O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?  
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,  
To entertain them fair with open Front  
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms  
Of composition, strait they chang’d thir minds,  
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,  
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd  
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps  
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose  
If our proposals once again were heard  
We should compel them to a quick result. </pre></div> </div>
