But longer in that Paradise to dwell,  
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:  
Those pure immortal Elements that know  
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,  
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off  
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,  
And mortal food, as may dispose him best  
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first  
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt  
Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts  
Created him endowd, with Happiness  
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,  
This other serv’d but to eternize woe;  
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes  
His final remedie, and after Life  
Tri’d in sharp tribulation, and refin’d  
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, </pre></div> </div>
