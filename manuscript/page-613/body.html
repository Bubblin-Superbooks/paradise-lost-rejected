More then anough, that temperance may be tri’d:  
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav’d,  
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;  
One Man except, the onely Son of light  
In a dark Age, against example good,  
Against allurement, custom, and a World  
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,  
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes  
Shall them admonish, and before them set  
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,  
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come  
On thir impenitence; and shall returne  
Of them derided, but of God observd  
The one just Man alive; by his command  
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,  
To save himself and houshold from amidst  
A World devote to universal rack. </pre></div> </div>
