Both him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host  
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d  
Fell with us from on high: from them I go  
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all  
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread  
Th’ unfounded deep, & through the void immense  
To search with wandring quest a place foretold  
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now  
Created vast and round, a place of bliss  
In the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t  
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply  
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d,  
Least Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude  
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught  
Then this more secret now design’d, I haste  
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,  
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death </pre></div> </div>
