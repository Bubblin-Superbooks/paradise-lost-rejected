Or in _Franciscan_ think to pass disguis’d;  
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,  
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs  
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov’d;  
And now Saint _Peter_ at Heav’ns Wicket seems  
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot  
Of Heav’ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe  
A violent cross wind from either Coast  
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry  
Into the devious Air; then might ye see  
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost  
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,  
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,  
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft  
Fly o’re the backside of the World farr off  
Into a _Limbo_ large and broad, since calld  
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown </pre></div> </div>
