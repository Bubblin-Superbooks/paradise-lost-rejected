Our State cannot be severd, we are one,  
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.  

So _Adam_, and thus _Eve_ to him repliâ€™d.  
O glorious trial of exceeding Love,  
Illustrious evidence, example high!  
Ingaging me to emulate, but short  
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,  
_Adam_, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,  
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,  
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff  
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,  
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread  
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,  
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,  
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,  
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, </pre></div> </div>
