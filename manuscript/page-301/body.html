And visage all enflam’d first thus began.  

Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,  
Unnam’d in Heav’n, now plenteous, as thou seest  
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,  
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self  
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb’d  
Heav’ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought  
Miserie, uncreated till the crime  
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill’d  
Thy malice into thousands, once upright  
And faithful, now prov’d false. But think not here  
To trouble Holy Rest; Heav’n casts thee out  
From all her Confines. Heav’n the seat of bliss  
Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.  
Hence then, and evil go with thee along  
Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, </pre></div> </div>
