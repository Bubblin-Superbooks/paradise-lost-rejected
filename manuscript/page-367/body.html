On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:  
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise  
In common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,  
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth  
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s

Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane

Floats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:  
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song  
Solac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings  
Till Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal  
Ceas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:  
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d  
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck  
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes  
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit </pre></div> </div>
