How provident he is, how farr from thought  
To make us less, bent rather to exalt  
Our happie state under one Head more neer  
United. But to grant it thee unjust,  
That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:  
Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count,  
Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,  
Equal to him begotten Son, by whom  
As by his Word the mighty Father made  
All things, ev’n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav’n  
By him created in thir bright degrees,  
Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam’d  
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers  
Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur’d,  
But more illustrious made, since he the Head  
One of our number thus reduc’t becomes,  
His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done </pre></div> </div>
