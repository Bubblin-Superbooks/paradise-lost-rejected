Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.  
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.  

They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung  
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch  
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,  
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.  
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight  
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;  
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd  
Innumerable. As when the potent Rod  
Of _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day  
Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud  
Of _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind,  
That ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung  
Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of _Nile_:  
So numberless were those bad Angels seen </pre></div> </div>
