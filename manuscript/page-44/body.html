And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel  
Jousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_,  
_Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_,  
Or whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore  
When _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell

Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess  
Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n  
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air  
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon  
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds  
On half the Nations, and with fear of change </pre></div> </div>
