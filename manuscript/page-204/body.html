That mock our scant manuring, and require  
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:  
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,  
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,  
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;

All seasons and thir change, all please alike.  
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,  
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun  
When first on this delightful Land he spreads </pre></div> </div>
