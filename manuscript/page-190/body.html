To mark what of thir state he more might learn  
By word or action markt: about them round  
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,  
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi’d  
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,  
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft  
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground  
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both  
Grip’t in each paw: when _Adam_ first of men  
To first of women _Eve_ thus moving speech,  
Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.  

Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,  
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power  
That made us, and for us this ample World  
Be infinitly good, and of his good  
As liberal and free as infinite, </pre></div> </div>
