The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.  
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,  
Insect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans  
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact  
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride  
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:  
These as a line thir long dimension drew,  
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all  
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde  
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv’d  
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept  
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident  
Of future, in small room large heart enclos’d,  
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps  
Hereafter, join’d in her popular Tribes  
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer’d  
The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone </pre></div> </div>
