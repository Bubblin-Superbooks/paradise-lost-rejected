Still following thee, still compassing thee round  
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face  
Express, and of his steps the track Divine.  
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,  
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent  
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes  
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad  
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending  
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn  
True patience, and to temper joy with fear  
And pious sorrow, equally enur’d  
By moderation either state to beare,  
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead  
Safest thy life, and best prepar’d endure  
Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend  
This Hill; let _Eve_ (for I have drencht her eyes)  
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak’st, </pre></div> </div>
