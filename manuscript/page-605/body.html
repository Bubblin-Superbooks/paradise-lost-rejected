_Adam_ was all in tears, and to his guide  
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,  
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death  
Inhumanly to men, and multiply  
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew  
His Brother; for of whom such massacher  
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?  
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav’n  
Rescu’d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?  

To whom thus _Michael_; These are the product  
Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw’st;  
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves  
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,  
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.  
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;  
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir’d, </pre></div> </div>
