With various living creatures, and the Aire  
Replenisht, and all these at thy command  
To come and play before thee, know’st thou not  
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,  
And reason not contemptibly; with these  
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.  
So spake the Universal Lord, and seem’d  
So ordering. I with leave of speech implor’d,  
And humble deprecation thus repli’d.  

Let not my words offend thee, Heav’nly Power,  
My Maker, be propitious while I speak.  
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,  
And these inferiour farr beneath me set?  
Among unequals what societie  
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?  
Which must be mutual, in proportion due </pre></div> </div>
