Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?  

To whom sad _Eve_ with shame nigh overwhelm’d,  
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge  
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli’d.  

The Serpent me beguil’d and I did eate.

Which when the Lord God heard, without delay  
To Judgement he proceeded on th’ accus’d  
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre  
The Guilt on him who made him instrument  
Of mischief, and polluted from the end  
Of his Creation; justly then accurst,  
As vitiated in Nature: more to know  
Concern’d not Man (since he no further knew)  
Nor alter’d his offence; yet God at last </pre></div> </div>
