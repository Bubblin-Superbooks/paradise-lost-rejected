And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:  
Under her Cloudie covert both retir’d,  
Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field  
_Michael_ and his Angels prevalent  
Encamping, plac’d in Guard thir Watches round,  
Cherubic waving fires: on th’ other part  
_Satan_ with his rebellious disappeerd,  
Far in the dark dislodg’d, and void of rest,  
His Potentates to Councel call’d by night;  
And in the midst thus undismai’d began.  

O now in danger tri’d, now known in Armes  
Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,  
Found worthy not of Libertie alone,  
Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,  
Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,  
Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, </pre></div> </div>
