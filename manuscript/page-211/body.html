_Adam_ from his fair Spouse, nor _Eve_ the Rites  
Mysterious of connubial Love refus’d:  
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk  
Of puritie and place and innocence,  
Defaming as impure what God declares  
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.  
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain  
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?  
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source  
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie,  
In Paradise of all things common else.  
By thee adulterous lust was driv’n from men  
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee  
Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,  
Relations dear, and all the Charities  
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.  
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, </pre></div> </div>
