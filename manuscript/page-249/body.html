But I will haste and from each bough and break,  
Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice  
To entertain our Angel guest, as hee  
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth  
God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav’n.  

So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste  
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent  
What choice to chuse for delicacie best,  
What order, so contriv’d as not to mix  
Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring  
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,  
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk  
Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds  
In _India_ East or West, or middle shoare  
In _Pontus_ or the _Punic_ Coast, or where  
_Alcinous_ reign’d, fruit of all kindes, in coate, </pre></div> </div>
