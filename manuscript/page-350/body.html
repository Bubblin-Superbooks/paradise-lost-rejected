Thir station, Heav’n yet populous retaines  
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes  
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent  
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:  
But least his heart exalt him in the harme  
Already done, to have dispeopl’d Heav’n,  
My damage fondly deem’d, I can repaire  
That detriment, if such it be to lose  
Self-lost, and in a moment will create  
Another World, out of one man a Race  
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,  
Not here, till by degrees of merit rais’d  
They open to themselves at length the way  
Up hither, under long obedience tri’d,  
And Earth be chang’d to Heavn, & Heav’n to Earth,  
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.  
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav’n, </pre></div> </div>
