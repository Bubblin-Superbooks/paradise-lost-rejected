Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd  
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms  
The Univers, and to each inward part

With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;  
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;  
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,  
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon  
In _Aarons_ Brest-plate, and a stone besides </pre></div> </div>
