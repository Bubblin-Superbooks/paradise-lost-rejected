Mount _Hermon_, yonder Sea, each place behold  
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare  
Mount _Carmel_; here the double-founted stream  
_Jordan_, true limit Eastward; but his Sons  
Shall dwell to _Senir_, that long ridge of Hills.  
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth  
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed  
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise  
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon  
Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,  
Whom _Faithful Abraham_ due time shall call,  
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,  
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;  
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs  
From _Canaan_, to a Land hereafter callâ€™d  
_Egypt_, divided by the River _Nile_;  
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes </pre></div> </div>
