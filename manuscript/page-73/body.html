Thick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire  
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d,  
And with the Majesty of darkness round  
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar  
Must’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?  
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light  
Imitate when we please? This Desart soile  
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;  
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise  
Magnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?  
Our torments also may in length of time  
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires  
As soft as now severe, our temper chang’d  
Into their temper; which must needs remove  
The sensible of pain. All things invite  
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State  
Of order, how in safety best we may </pre></div> </div>
