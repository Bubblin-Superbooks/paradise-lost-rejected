O miserable Mankind, to what fall  
Degraded, to what wretched state reserv’d?  
Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv’n  
To be thus wrested from us? rather why  
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew  
What we receive, would either not accept  
Life offer’d, or soon beg to lay it down,  
Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus  
Th’ Image of God in man created once  
So goodly and erect, though faultie since,  
To such unsightly sufferings be debas’t  
Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,  
Retaining still Divine similitude  
In part, from such deformities be free,  
And for his Makers Image sake exempt? </pre></div> </div>
