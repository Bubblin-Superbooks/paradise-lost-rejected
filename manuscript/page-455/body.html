I was at first as other Beasts that graze  
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,  
As was my food, nor aught but food discern’d  
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:  
Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc’d  
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold  
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,  
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;  
When from the boughes a savorie odour blow’n,  
Grateful to appetite, more pleas’d my sense  
Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats  
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,  
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.  
To satisfie the sharp desire I had  
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv’d  
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,  
Powerful perswaders, quick’nd at the scent </pre></div> </div>
