Though threat’nd, which no worse then this can bring  
And what are Gods that Man may not become  
As they, participating God-like food?  
The Gods are first, and that advantage use  
On our belief, that all from them proceeds,  
I question it, for this fair Earth I see,  
Warm’d by the Sun, producing every kind,  
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos’d  
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,  
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains  
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies  
Th’ offence, that Man should thus attain to know?  
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree  
Impart against his will if all be his?  
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell  
In heav’nly brests? these, these and many more  
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. </pre></div> </div>
