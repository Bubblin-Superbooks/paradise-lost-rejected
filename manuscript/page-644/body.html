By Faith not void of works: this God-like act  
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy’d,  
In sin for ever lost from life; this act  
Shall bruise the head of _Satan_, crush his strength  
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,  
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings  
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,  
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,  
A gentle wafting to immortal Life.  
Nor after resurrection shall he stay  
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer  
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life  
Still follow’d him; to them shall leave in charge  
To teach all nations what of him they learn’d  
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve  
Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe  
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life </pre></div> </div>
