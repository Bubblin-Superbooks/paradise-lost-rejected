With spiritual Armour, able to resist  
_Satans_ assaults, and quench his fierie darts  
What Man can do against them, not affraid,  
Though to the death, against such cruelties  
With inward consolations recompenc’t,  
And oft supported so as shall amaze  
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit  
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends  
To evangelize the Nations, then on all  
Baptiz’d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue  
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,  
As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win  
Great numbers of each Nation to receave  
With joy the tidings brought from Heav’n: at length  
Thir Ministry perform’d, and race well run,  
Thir doctrine and thir story written left,  
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, </pre></div> </div>
