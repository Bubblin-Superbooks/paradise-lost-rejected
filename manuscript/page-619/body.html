Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave  
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine  
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:  
Henceforth what is to com I will relate,  
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.  
This second sours of Men, while yet but few,  
And while the dread of judgement past remains  
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,  
With some regard to what is just and right  
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,  
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,  
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,  
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,  
With large Wine-offerings pour’d, and sacred Feast  
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam’d, and dwell  
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes  
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise </pre></div> </div>
