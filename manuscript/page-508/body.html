Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;  
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:  
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins  
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more  
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,  
Araying cover’d from his Fathers sight.  
To him with swift ascent he up returnd,  
Into his blissful bosom reassum’d  
In glory as of old, to him appeas’d  
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man  
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.  
Meanwhile ere thus was sin’d and judg’d on Earth,  
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,  
In counterview within the Gates, that now  
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame  
Farr into _Chaos_, since the Fiend pass’d through,  
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. </pre></div> </div>
