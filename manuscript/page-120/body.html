As from her outmost works a brok’n foe  
With tumult less and with less hostile din,  
That _Satan_ with less toil, and now with ease  
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light  
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds  
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;  
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,  
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold  
Farr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide  
In circuit, undetermind square or round,  
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d  
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;  
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain  
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr  
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.  
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,  
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
