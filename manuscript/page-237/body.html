Two other precious drops that ready stood,  
Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell  
Kiss’d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse  
And pious awe, that feard to have offended.

Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen  
With wheels yet hov’ring o’re the Ocean brim,  
Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,  
Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East  
Of Paradise and _Edens_ happie Plains,  
Lowly they bow’d adoring, and began  
Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid  
In various style, for neither various style </pre></div> </div>
