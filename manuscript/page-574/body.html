Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind  
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,  
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?  
Here let us live, though in fall’n state, content.  

So spake, so wish’d much-humbl’d _Eve_, but Fate  
Subscrib’d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest  
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips’d  
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight  
The Bird of _Jove_, stoopt from his aerie tour,  
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:  
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,  
First Hunter then, pursu’d a gentle brace,  
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;  
Direct to th’ Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.  
_Adam_ observ’d, and with his Eye the chase  
Pursuing, not unmov’d to _Eve_ thus spake. </pre></div> </div>
