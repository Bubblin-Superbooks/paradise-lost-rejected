Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee  
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate  
And propitiation, all his works on mee  
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those  
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.  
Accept me, and in mee from these receave  
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live  
Before thee reconcilâ€™d, at least his days  
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I  
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)  
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee  
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,  
Made one with me as I with thee am one.  

To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.  
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,  
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: </pre></div> </div>
