Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?  
These changes in the Heav’ns, though slow, produc’d  
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,  
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,  
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North  
Of _Norumbega_, and the _Samoed_ shoar  
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice  
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,  
_Boreas_ and _Caecias_ and _Argestes_ loud  
And _Thrascias_ rend the Woods and Seas upturn;  
With adverse blast up-turns them from the South  
_Notus_ and _Afer_ black with thundrous Clouds  
From _Serraliona_; thwart of these as fierce  
Forth rush the _Levant_ and the _Ponent_ VVindes  
_Eurus_ and _Zephir_ with thir lateral noise,  
_Sirocco_, and _Libecchio_. Thus began  
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first </pre></div> </div>
