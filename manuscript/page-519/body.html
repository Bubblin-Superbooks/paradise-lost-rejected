There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth  
Dominion exercise and in the Aire,  
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar’d,  
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.  
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create  
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might  
Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now  
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,  
Through Sin to Death expos’d by my exploit.  
If your joynt power prevaile, th’ affaires of Hell  
No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.  

So saying he dismiss’d them, they with speed  
Thir course through thickest Constellations held  
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,  
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips  
Then sufferd. Th’ other way _Satan_ went down </pre></div> </div>
