Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,  
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,  
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;  
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,  
Single or in Array of Battel rang’d  
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;  
One way a Band select from forage drives  
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine  
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,  
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,  
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,  
But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;  
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;  
Where Cattel pastur’d late, now scatterd lies  
With Carcasses and Arms th’ ensanguind Field  
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong  
Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, </pre></div> </div>
