In either hand the hastning Angel caught  
Our lingring Parents, and to th’ Eastern Gate  
Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast  
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer’d.  
They looking back, all th’ Eastern side beheld  
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,  
Wav’d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate  
With dreadful Faces throng’d and fierie Armes:  
Som natural tears they drop’d, but wip’d them soon;  
The World was all before them, where to choose  
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:  
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,  
Through _Eden_ took thir solitarie way.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
