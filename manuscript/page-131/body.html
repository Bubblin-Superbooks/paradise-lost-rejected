So should thy goodness and thy greatness both  
Be questiond and blaspheam’d without defence.  

To whom the great Creatour thus reply’d.  
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,  
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone  
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,  
All hast thou spok’n as my thoughts are, all  
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:  
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will,  
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me  
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew  
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall’d  
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;  
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand  
On even ground against his mortal foe,  
By me upheld, that he may know how frail </pre></div> </div>
