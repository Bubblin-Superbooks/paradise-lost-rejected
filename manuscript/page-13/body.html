And rest can never dwell, hope never comes  
That comes to all; but torture without end  
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed  
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:  
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d  
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d  
In utter darkness, and their portion set  
As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n  
As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.

With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,  
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side  
One next himself in power, and next in crime,  
Long after known in _Palestine_, and nam’d  
_Beelzebub_. To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,  
And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words </pre></div> </div>
