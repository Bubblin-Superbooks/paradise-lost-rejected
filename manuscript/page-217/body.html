That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,  
Departed from thee, and thou resembl’st now  
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.  
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account  
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep  
This place inviolable, and these from harm.  

So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke  
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace  
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,  
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw  
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin’d  
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd  
His lustre visibly impar’d; yet seemd  
Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,  
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,  
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, </pre></div> </div>
