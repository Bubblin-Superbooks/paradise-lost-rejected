O Heav’n! that such resemblance of the Highest  
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie  
Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might  
There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove  
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?  
His puissance, trusting in th’ Almightie’s aide,  
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri’d  
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,  
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,  
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike  
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,  
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so  
Most reason is that Reason overcome.  

So pondering, and from his armed Peers  
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met </pre></div> </div>
