And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,  
But suddenly with flesh fill’d up & heal’d:  
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;  
Under his forming hands a Creature grew,  
Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,  
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now  
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd  
And in her looks, which from that time infus’d  
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,  
And into all things from her Aire inspir’d  
The spirit of love and amorous delight.  
She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak’d  
To find her, or for ever to deplore  
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:  
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,  
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd  
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow </pre></div> </div>
