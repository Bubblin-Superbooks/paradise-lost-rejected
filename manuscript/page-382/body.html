Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;  
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.  

So spake our Sire, and by his count’nance seemd  
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which _Eve_  
Perceaving where she sat retir’d in sight,  
With lowliness Majestic from her seat,  
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,  
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,  
To visit how they prosper’d, bud and bloom,  
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung  
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.  
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse  
Delighted, or not capable her eare  
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv’d,  
_Adam_ relating, she sole Auditress;  
Her Husband the Relater she preferr’d </pre></div> </div>
