So saying, she embrac’d him, and for joy  
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love  
Had so enobl’d, as of choice to incurr  
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.  
In recompence (for such compliance bad

With liberal hand: he scrupl’d not to eat  
Against his better knowledge, not deceav’d,  
But fondly overcome with Femal charm.  
Earth trembl’d from her entrails, as again  
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,  
Skie lowr’d, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops  
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin  
Original; while _Adam_ took no thought,  
Eating his fill, nor _Eve_ to iterate </pre></div> </div>
