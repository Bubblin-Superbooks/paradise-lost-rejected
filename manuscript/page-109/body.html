Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down  
Into this gloom of _Tartarus_ profound,  
To sit in hateful Office here confin’d,  
Inhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born,  
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,  
With terrors and with clamors compasst round  
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:  
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou  
My being gav’st me; whom should I obey  
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon  
To that new world of light and bliss, among  
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign  
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems  
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.  

Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,  
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; </pre></div> </div>
