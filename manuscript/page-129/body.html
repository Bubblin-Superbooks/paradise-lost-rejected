Through Heav’n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,  
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.  

Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d  
All Heav’n, and in the blessed Spirits elect  
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d:  
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen  
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon  
Substantially express’d, and in his face  
Divine compassion visibly appeerd,  
Love without end, and without measure Grace,  
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.  

O Father, gracious was that word which clos’d  
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;  
For which both Heav’n and Earth shall high extoll  
Thy praises, with th’ innumerable sound </pre></div> </div>
