Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc’d so deep:  
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse  
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare  
Short intermission bought with double smart.  
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr  
From granting hee, as I from begging peace:  
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead  
Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,  
Mankind created, and for him this World.  
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,  
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;  
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least  
Divided Empire with Heav’ns King I hold  
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;  
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.  

Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face </pre></div> </div>
