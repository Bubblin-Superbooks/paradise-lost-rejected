Who slew his Brother; studious they appere  
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,  
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit  
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg’d none.  
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;  
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd  
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,  
Yet empty of all good wherein consists  
Womans domestic honour and chief praise;  
Bred onely and completed to the taste  
Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,  
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.  
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives  
Religious titl’d them the Sons of God,  
Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame  
Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles  
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, </pre></div> </div>
