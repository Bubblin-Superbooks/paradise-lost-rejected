Within me cleere, not onely to discerne  
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes  
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.  
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe  
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:  
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life  
To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee,  
Mee who have touch’d and tasted, yet both live,  
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate  
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.  
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast  
Is open? or will God incense his ire  
For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise  
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain  
Of Death denounc’t, whatever thing Death be,  
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade  
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; </pre></div> </div>
