And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,  
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs  
Hide me, where I may never see them more.  
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise  
What best may for the present serve to hide  
The Parts of each from other, that seem most  
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,  
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,  
And girded on our loyns, may cover round  
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,  
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.  

So counsel’d hee, and both together went  
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose  
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown’d,  
But such as at this day to _Indians_ known  
In _Malabar_ or _Decan_ spreds her Armes </pre></div> </div>
