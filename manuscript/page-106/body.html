Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,  
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.  
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun  
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope  
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,  
Though temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,  
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.  

She finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore  
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.  
Dear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,  
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge  
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys  
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change  
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know  
I come no enemie, but to set free  
From out this dark and dismal house of pain, </pre></div> </div>
