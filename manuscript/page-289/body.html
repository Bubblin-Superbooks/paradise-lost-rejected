Of Union irresistible, mov’d on  
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound  
Of instrumental Harmonie that breath’d  
Heroic Ardor to advent’rous deeds  
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause  
Of God and his _Messiah_. On they move  
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,  
Nor streit’ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides  
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground  
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore  
Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind  
Of Birds in orderly array on wing  
Came summond over _Eden_ to receive  
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract  
Of Heav’n they march’d, and many a Province wide  
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last  
Farr in th’ Horizon to the North appeer’d </pre></div> </div>
