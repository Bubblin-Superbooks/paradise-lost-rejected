Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,  
That stone, or like to that which here below  
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,  
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde  
Volatil _Hermes_, and call up unbound  
In various shapes old _Proteus_ from the Sea,  
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.  
What wonder then if fields and regions here  
Breathe forth _Elixir_ pure, and Rivers run  
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch  
Th’ Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote  
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt  
Here in the dark so many precious things  
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?  
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met  
Undazl’d, farr and wide his eye commands,  
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, </pre></div> </div>
