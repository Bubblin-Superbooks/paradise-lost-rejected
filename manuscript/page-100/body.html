In th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair  
Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head  
Level’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands  
No second stroke intend, and such a frown  
Each cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds  
With Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on  
Over the _Caspian_, then stand front to front  
Hov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow  
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:  
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell  
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;  
For never but once more was either like  
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds  
Had been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,  
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat  
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,  
Ris’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between. </pre></div> </div>
