But whom thou hat’st, I hate, and can put on  
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,  
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,  
Armd with thy might, rid heav’n of these rebell’d,  
To thir prepar’d ill Mansion driven down  
To chains of Darkness, and th’ undying Worm,  
That from thy just obedience could revolt,  
Whom to obey is happiness entire.  
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th’ impure  
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount  
Unfained _Halleluiahs_ to thee sing,  
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.  
So said, he o’re his Scepter bowing, rose  
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,  
And the third sacred Morn began to shine  
Dawning through Heav’n: forth rush’d with whirlwind sound </pre></div> </div>
