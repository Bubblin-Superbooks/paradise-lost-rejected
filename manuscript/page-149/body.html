Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born  
First from the ancient World those Giants came  
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:  
The builders next of _Babel_ on the Plain  
Of _Sennaar_, and still with vain designe  
New _Babels_, had they wherewithall, would build:  
Others came single; hee who to be deemd  
A God, leap’d fondly into _Aetna_ flames,  
_Empedocles_, and hee who to enjoy  
_Plato’s Elysium_, leap’d into the Sea,  
_Cleombrotus_, and many more too long,  
Embryo’s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers  
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.  
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray’d so farr to seek  
In _Golgotha_ him dead, who lives in Heav’n;  
And they who to be sure of Paradise  
Dying put on the weeds of _Dominic_, </pre></div> </div>
