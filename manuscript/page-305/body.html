But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar’d  
All his right side; then _Satan_ first knew pain,  
And writh’d him to and fro convolv’d; so sore  
The griding sword with discontinuous wound  
Pass’d through him, but th’ Ethereal substance clos’d  
Not long divisible, and from the gash  
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow’d  
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,  
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.  
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run  
By Angels many and strong, who interpos’d  
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields  
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir’d  
From off the files of warr; there they him laid  
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame  
To find himself not matchless, and his pride  
Humbl’d by such rebuke, so farr beneath </pre></div> </div>
