Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God  
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,  
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward  
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;  
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.  

He look’d, & saw the face of things quite chang’d;  
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,  
All now was turn’d to jollitie and game,  
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,  
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,  
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire  
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.  
At length a Reverend Sire among them came,  
And of thir doings great dislike declar’d,  
And testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft  
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, </pre></div> </div>
