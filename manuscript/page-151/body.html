Long after, now unpeopl’d, and untrod;  
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass’d,  
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame  
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste  
His travell’d steps; farr distant hee descries  
Ascending by degrees magnificent  
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,  
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd  
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate  
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold  
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes  
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth  
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.  
The Stairs were such as whereon _Jacob_ saw  
Angels ascending and descending, bands  
Of Guardians bright, when he from _Esau_ fled  
To _Padan-Aram_ in the field of _Luz_, </pre></div> </div>
