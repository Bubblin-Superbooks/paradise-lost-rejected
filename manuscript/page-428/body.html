For whom all this was made, all this will soon  
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,  
In wo then; that destruction wide may range:  
To mee shall be the glorie sole among  
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr’d  
What he _Almightie_ styl’d, six Nights and Days  
Continu’d making, and who knows how long  
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps  
Not longer then since I in one Night freed  
From servitude inglorious welnigh half  
Th’ Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng  
Of his adorers: hee to be aveng’d,  
And to repaire his numbers thus impair’d,  
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild  
More Angels to Create, if they at least  
Are his Created or to spite us more,  
Determin’d to advance into our room </pre></div> </div>
