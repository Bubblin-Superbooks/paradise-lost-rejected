His confidence to equal God in power.  
Yet soon he heal’d; for Spirits that live throughout  
Vital in every part, not as frail man  
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,  
Cannot but by annihilating die;  
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound  
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:  
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,  
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,  
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size  
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.  

Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd  
Memorial, where the might of _Gabriel_ fought,  
And with fierce Ensignes pierc’d the deep array  
Of _Moloc_ furious King, who him defi’d,  
And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound </pre></div> </div>
