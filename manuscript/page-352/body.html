So told as earthly notion can receave.  
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav’n  
When such was heard declar’d the Almightie’s will;  
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will  
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:  
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire  
Had driven out th’ ungodly from his sight  
And th’ habitations of the just; to him  
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain’d  
Good out of evil to create, in stead  
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring  
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse  
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.  
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son  
On his great Expedition now appeer’d,  
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown’d  
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love </pre></div> </div>
