Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn’d,  
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?  
Should God create another _Eve_, and I  
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee  
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel  
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,  
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State  
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.  

So having said, as one from sad dismay  
Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd  
Submitting to what seemd remediless,  
Thus in calme mood his Words to _Eve_ he turnd.  

Bold deed thou hast presum’d, adventrous _Eve_,  
And peril great provok’t, who thus hast dar’d  
Had it bin onely coveting to Eye </pre></div> </div>
