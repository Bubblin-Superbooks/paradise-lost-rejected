To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood  
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,  
With Jubilie advanc’d; and as they went,  
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,  
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,  
Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv’n,  
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode  
Triumphant through mid Heav’n, into the Courts  
And Temple of his mightie Father Thron’d  
On high; who into Glorie him receav’d,  
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.  

Thus measuring things in Heav’n by things on Earth  
At thy request, and that thou maist beware  
By what is past, to thee I have reveal’d  
What might have else to human Race bin hid;  
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav’n </pre></div> </div>
