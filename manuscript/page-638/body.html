Foretold to _Abraham_, as in whom shall trust  
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings  
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.  
But first a long succession must ensue,  
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam’d,  
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents  
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.  
Such follow him, as shall be registerd  
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,  
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults  
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense  
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,  
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark  
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey  
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw’st  
Left in confusion, _Babylon_ thence call’d.  
There in captivitie he lets them dwell </pre></div> </div>
