Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel  
His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.  
Then who created thee lamenting learne,  
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.  

So spake the Seraph _Abdiel_ faithful found,  
Among the faithless, faithful only hee;  
Among innumerable false, unmov’d,  
Unshak’n, unseduc’d, unterrifi’d  
His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;  
Nor number, nor example with him wrought  
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind  
Though single. From amidst them forth he passd,  
Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind  
Superior, nor of violence fear’d aught;  
And with retorted scorn his back he turn’d  
On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom’d.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
