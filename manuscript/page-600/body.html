Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,  
And charming Symphonies attach’d the heart  
Of _Adam_, soon enclin’d to admit delight,  
The bent of Nature; which he thus express’d.  

True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,  
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope  
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;  
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,  
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.  

To whom thus _Michael_. Judg not what is best  
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,  
Created, as thou art, to nobler end  
Holie and pure, conformitie divine.  
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents  
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race </pre></div> </div>
