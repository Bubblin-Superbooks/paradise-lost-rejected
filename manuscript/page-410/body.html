She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,  
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,  
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,  
That would be woo’d, and not unsought be won,  
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir’d,  
The more desirable, or to say all,  
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,  
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn’d;  
I follow’d her, she what was Honour knew,  
And with obsequious Majestie approv’d  
My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre  
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav’n,  
And happie Constellations on that houre  
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth  
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;  
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires </pre></div> </div>
