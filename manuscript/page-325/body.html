Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,  
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads  
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air  
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm’d,  
Thir armor help’d thir harm, crush’t in and brus’d  
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain  
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,  
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind  
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,  
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.  
The rest in imitation to like Armes  
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;  
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills  
Hurl’d to and fro with jaculation dire,  
That under ground they fought in dismal shade;  
Infernal noise; Warr seem’d a civil Game  
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt </pre></div> </div>
