Her former trespass fear’d, the more to soothe  
Him with her lov’d societie, that now  
As with new Wine intoxicated both  
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel  
Divinitie within them breeding wings  
Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit  
Farr other operation first displaid,  
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on _Eve_  
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him  
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:  
Till _Adam_ thus ’gan _Eve_ to dalliance move.  

_Eve_, now I see thou art exact of taste,  
And elegant, of Sapience no small part,  
Since to each meaning savour we apply,  
And Palate call judicious; I the praise  
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey’d. </pre></div> </div>
