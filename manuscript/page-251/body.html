Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,  
As to a superior Nature, bowing low,  

Thus said. Native of Heav’n, for other place  
None can then Heav’n such glorious shape contain;  
Since by descending from the Thrones above,  
Those happie places thou hast deignd a while  
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us  
Two onely, who yet by sov’ran gift possess  
This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre  
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears  
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat  
Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.  

Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.  
_Adam_, I therefore came, nor art thou such  
Created, or such place hast here to dwell, </pre></div> </div>
