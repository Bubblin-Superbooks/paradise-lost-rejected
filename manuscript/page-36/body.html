To Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind,  
Whose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allur’d  
The _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate  
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,  
While smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock  
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood  
Of _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale  
Infected _Sions_ daughters with like heat,  
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch  
_Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led  
His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries  
Of alienated _Judah_. Next came one  
Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark  
Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off  
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,  
Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:  
_Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man </pre></div> </div>
