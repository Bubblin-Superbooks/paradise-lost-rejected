Favour unmerited by me, who sought  
Forbidd’n knowledge by forbidd’n means.  
This yet I apprehend not, why to those  
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth  
So many and so various Laws are giv’n;  
So many Laws argue so many sins  
Among them; how can God with such reside?  

To whom thus _Michael_. Doubt not but that sin  
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;  
And therefore was Law given them to evince  
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up  
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see  
Law can discover sin, but not remove,  
Save by those shadowie expiations weak,  
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude  
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, </pre></div> </div>
