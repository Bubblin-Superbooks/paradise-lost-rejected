Of _Bacchus_ and his Revellers, the Race  
Of that wilde Rout that tore the _Thracian_ Bard  
In _Rhodope_, where Woods and Rocks had Eares  
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround  
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend  
Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:  
For thou art Heav’nlie, shee an empty dreame.  

Say Goddess, what ensu’d when _Raphael_,  
The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn’d  
_Adam_ by dire example to beware  
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven  
To those Apostates, least the like befall  
In Paradise to _Adam_ or his Race,  
Charg’d not to touch the interdicted Tree,  
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,  
So easily obeyd amid the choice </pre></div> </div>
