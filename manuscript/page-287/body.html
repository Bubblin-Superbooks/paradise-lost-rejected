The better fight, who single hast maintaind  
Against revolted multitudes the Cause  
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;  
And for the testimonie of Truth hast born  
Universal reproach, far worse to beare  
Then violence: for this was all thy care  
To stand approv’d in sight of God, though Worlds  
Judg’d thee perverse: the easier conquest now  
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,  
Back on thy foes more glorious to return  
Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue  
By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,  
Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King  
_Messiah_, who by right of merit Reigns.  
Goe _Michael_ of Celestial Armies Prince,  
And thou in Military prowess next  
_Gabriel_, lead forth to Battel these my Sons </pre></div> </div>
