Lament not _Eve_, but patiently resigne  
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,  
Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;  
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes  
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;  
Where he abides, think there thy native soile.  

_Adam_ by this from the cold sudden damp  
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,  
To _Michael_ thus his humble words addressd.  

Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or namâ€™d  
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem  
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould  
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,  
And in performing end us; what besides  
Of sorrow and dejection and despair </pre></div> </div>
