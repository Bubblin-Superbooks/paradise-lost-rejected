In our defence, lest unawares we lose  
This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.  

To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer  
Light’ning Divine, ineffable, serene,  
Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes  
Justly hast in derision, and secure  
Laugh’st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,  
Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate  
Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power  
Giv’n me to quell thir pride, and in event  
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue  
Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav’n.  

So spake the Son, but _Satan_ with his Powers  
Farr was advanc’t on winged speed, an Host  
Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, </pre></div> </div>
