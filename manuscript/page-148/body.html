Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin  
With vanity had filld the works of men:  
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things  
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,  
Or happiness in this or th’ other life;  
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits  
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,  
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find  
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;  
All th’ unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,  
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,  
Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,  
Till final dissolution, wander here,  
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;  
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,  
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold  
Betwixt th’ Angelical and Human kinde: </pre></div> </div>
