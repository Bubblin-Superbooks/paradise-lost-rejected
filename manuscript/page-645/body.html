Pure, and in mind prepar’d, if so befall,  
For death, like that which the redeemer dy’d.  
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day  
Not onely to the Sons of _Abrahams_ Loines  
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons  
Of _Abrahams_ Faith wherever through the world;  
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.  
Then to the Heav’n of Heav’ns he shall ascend  
With victory, triumphing through the aire  
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise  
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines  
Through all his realme, & there confounded leave;  
Then enter into glory, and resume  
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high  
Above all names in Heav’n; and thence shall come,  
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,  
With glory and power to judge both quick & dead, </pre></div> </div>
