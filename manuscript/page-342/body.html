Return me to my Native Element:  
Least from this flying Steed unrein’d, (as once  
_Bellerophon_, though from a lower Clime)  
Dismounted, on th’ _Aleian_ Field I fall  
Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.  
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound  
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;  
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,  
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang’d  
To hoarce or mute, though fall’n on evil dayes,  
On evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;  
In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,  
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou  
Visit’st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn  
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,  
_Urania_, and fit audience find, though few.  
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance </pre></div> </div>
