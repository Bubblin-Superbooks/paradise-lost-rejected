For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?  
Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt?  
Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile  
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d  
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride  
Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host  
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring  
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,  
He trusted to have equal’d the most High,  
If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim  
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God  
Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud  
With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power  
Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie  
With hideous ruine and combustion down  
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell  
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, </pre></div> </div>
