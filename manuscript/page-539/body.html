Of God, whom to behold was then my highth  
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end  
The miserie, I deservâ€™d it, and would beare  
My own deservings; but this will not serve;  
All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,  
Is propagated curse. O voice once heard  
Delightfully, _Encrease and Multiply_,  
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease  
Or multiplie, but curses on my head?  
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling  
The evil on him brought by me, will curse  
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,  
For this we may thank _Adam_; but his thanks  
Shall be the execration; so besides  
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee  
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,  
On mee as on thir natural center light </pre></div> </div>
