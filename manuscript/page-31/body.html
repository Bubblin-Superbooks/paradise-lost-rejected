Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d  
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.  
Nor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_  
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,  
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,  
By falsities and lyes the greatest part  
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake  
God their Creator, and th’ invisible  
Glory of him, that made them, to transform  
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d  
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,  
And Devils to adore for Deities:  
Then were they known to men by various Names,  
And various Idols through the Heathen World.  
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,  
Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, </pre></div> </div>
