In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope  
Of Heav’n perhaps, or all the Elements  
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne  
With violence of this conflict, had not soon  
Th’ Eternal to prevent such horrid fray  
Hung forth in Heav’n his golden Scales, yet seen  
Betwixt _Astrea_ and the _Scorpion_ signe,  
Wherein all things created first he weighd,  
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc’t Aire  
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,  
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights  
The sequel each of parting and of fight;  
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;  
Which _Gabriel_ spying, thus bespake the Fiend.  

_Satan_, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,  
Neither our own but giv’n; what follie then </pre></div> </div>
