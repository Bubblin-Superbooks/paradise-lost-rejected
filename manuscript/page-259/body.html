Reason receives, and reason is her being,  
Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse  
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,  
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.  
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good  
If I refuse not, but convert, as you,  
To proper substance; time may come when men  
With Angels may participate, and find  
No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:  
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps  
Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit  
Improv’d by tract of time, and wingd ascend  
Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice  
Here or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell;  
If ye be found obedient, and retain  
Unalterably firm his love entire  
Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy </pre></div> </div>
