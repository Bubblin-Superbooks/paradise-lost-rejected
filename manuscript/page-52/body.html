With Golden Architrave; nor did there want  
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,  
The Roof was fretted Gold. Not _Babilon_,  
Nor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence  
Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine  
_Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat  
Thir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove  
In wealth and luxurie. Th’ ascending pile  
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores  
Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide  
Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth  
And level pavement: from the arched roof  
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row  
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed  
With Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light  
As from a sky. The hasty multitude  
Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise </pre></div> </div>
