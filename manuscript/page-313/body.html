Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain  
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands  
Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well  
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,  
But live content, which is the calmest life:

Which of us who beholds the bright surface </pre></div> </div>
