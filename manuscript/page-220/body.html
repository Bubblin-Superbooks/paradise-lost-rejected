Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?  

To whom thus _Satan_ with contemptuous brow.  
_Gabriel_, thou hadst in Heav’n th’ esteem of wise,  
And such I held thee; but this question askt  
Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain?  
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,  
Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,  
And boldly venture to whatever place  
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change  
Torment with ease, & soonest recompence  
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;  
To thee no reason; who knowst only good,  
But evil hast not tri’d: and wilt object  
His will who bound us? let him surer barr </pre></div> </div>
