Dextrously thou aim’st;So willingly doth God remit his Ire,Though late repenting him of Man deprav’d,Griev’d at his heart, when looking down he sawThe whole Earth fill’d with violence, and all fleshCorrupting each thir way; yet those remoov’d,Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,That he relents, not to blot out mankind,And makes a Covenant never to destroyThe Earth again by flood, nor let the SeaSurpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the WorldWith Man therein or Beast; but when he bringsOver the Earth a Cloud, will therein setHis triple-colour’d Bow, whereon to lookAnd call to mind his Cov’nant: Day and Night,Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary FrostShall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,Both Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;And Man as from a second stock</p></div> </div>
