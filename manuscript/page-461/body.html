The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love  
To Man, and indignation at his wrong,  
New part puts on, and as to passion mov’d,  
Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act  
Rais’d, as of som great matter to begin.  
As when of old som Orator renound  
In _Athens_ or free _Rome_, where Eloquence  
Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,  
Stood in himself collected, while each part,  
Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,  
Somtimes in highth began, as no delay  
Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.  
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown  
The Tempter all impassiond thus began.  

O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,  
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power </pre></div> </div>
