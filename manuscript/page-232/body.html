I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;  
To find thee I directed then my walk;  
And on, methought, alone I pass’d through ways  
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree  
Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem’d,  
Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:  
And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood  
One shap’d & wing’d like one of those from Heav’n  
By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill’d  
Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz’d;  
And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg’d,  
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,  
Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis’d?  
Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?  
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold  
Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?  
This said he paus’d not, but with ventrous Arme </pre></div> </div>
