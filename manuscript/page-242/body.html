Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr  
Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check  
Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine  
To wed her Elm; she spous’d about him twines  
Her mariageable arms, and with her brings  
Her dowr th’ adopted Clusters, to adorn  
His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld  
With pittie Heav’ns high King, and to him call’d  
_Raphael_, the sociable Spirit, that deign’d  
To travel with _Tobias_, and secur’d  
His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.  

_Raphael_, said hee, thou hear’st what stir on Earth  
_Satan_ from Hell scap’t through the darksom Gulf  
Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd  
This night the human pair, how he designes  
In them at once to ruin all mankind. </pre></div> </div>
