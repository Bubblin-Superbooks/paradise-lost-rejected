To gratifie my scornful Enemies,  
That laugh, as if transported with some fit  
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,  
At random yeilded up to their misrule;  
And know not that I call’d and drew them thither  
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth  
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed  
On what was pure, till cramm’d and gorg’d, nigh burst  
With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling  
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,  
Both _Sin_, and _Death_, and yawning _Grave_ at last  
Through _Chaos_ hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell  
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.  
Then Heav’n and Earth renewd shall be made pure  
To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:  
Till then the Curse pronounc’t on both precedes. </pre></div> </div>
