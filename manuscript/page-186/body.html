On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:  
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde  
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;  
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles  
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems  
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,  
Alone as they. About them frisking playd  
All Beasts of th’ Earth, since wilde, and of all chase  
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;  
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw  
Dandl’d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards  
Gambold before them, th’ unwieldy Elephant  
To make them mirth us’d all his might, & wreathd  
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly  
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine  
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile  
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass </pre></div> </div>
