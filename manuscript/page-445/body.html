Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades  
Waited with hellish rancor imminent  
To intercept thy way, or send thee back  
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.  
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,  
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,  
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde  
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them  
The whole included Race, his purposd prey.  
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft  
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,  
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,  
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet  
He sought them both, but wish’d his hap might find  
_Eve_ separate, he wish’d, but not with hope  
Of what so seldom chanc’d, when to his wish,  
Beyond his hope, _Eve_ separate he spies, </pre></div> </div>
