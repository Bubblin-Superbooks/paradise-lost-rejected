Which we in our appointed work imployd  
Have finisht happie in our mutual help  
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss  
Ordain’d by thee, and this delicious place  
For us too large, where thy abundance wants  
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.  
But thou hast promis’d from us two a Race  
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll  
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,  
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.  

This said unanimous, and other Rites  
Observing none, but adoration pure  
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower  
Handed they went; and eas’d the putting off  
These troublesom disguises which wee wear,  
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene </pre></div> </div>
