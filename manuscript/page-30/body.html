Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell  
’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;  
Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear  
Of their great Sultan waving to direct  
Thir course, in even ballance down they light  
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;  
A multitude, like which the populous North  
Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass  
_Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons  
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread  
Beneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands.  
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band  
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood  
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms  
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,  
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;  
Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now </pre></div> </div>
