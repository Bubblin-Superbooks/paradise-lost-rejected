Threatn’d, nor from the Holie One of Heav’n  
Refrein’d his tongue blasphemous; but anon  
Down clov’n to the waste, with shatterd Armes  
And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing  
_Uriel_ and _Raphael_ his vaunting foe,  
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,  
Vanquish’d _Adramelec_, and _Asmadai_,  
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods  
Disdain’d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,  
Mangl’d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.  
Nor stood unmindful _Abdiel_ to annoy  
The Atheist crew, but with redoubl’d blow  
_Ariel_ and _Arioc_, and the violence  
Of _Ramiel_ scorcht and blasted overthrew.  
I might relate of thousands, and thir names  
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect  
Angels contented with thir fame in Heav’n </pre></div> </div>
