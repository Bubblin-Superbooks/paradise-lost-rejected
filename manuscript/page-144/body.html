Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,  
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,  
Yet dazle Heav’n, that brightest Seraphim  
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.  
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,  
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,  
In whose conspicuous count’nance, without cloud  
Made visible, th’ Almighty Father shines,  
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee  
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,  
Transfus’d on thee his ample Spirit rests.  
Hee Heav’n of Heavens and all the Powers therein  
By thee created, and by thee threw down  
Th’ aspiring Dominations: thou that day  
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,  
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook  
Heav’ns everlasting Frame, while o’re the necks </pre></div> </div>
