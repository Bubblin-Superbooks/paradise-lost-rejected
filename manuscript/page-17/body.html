Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;  
And put to proof his high Supremacy,  
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,  
Too well I see and rue the dire event,  
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat  
Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host  
In horrible destruction laid thus low,  
As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences  
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains  
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,  
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state  
Here swallow’d up in endless misery.  
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now  
Of force believe Almighty, since no less  
Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)  
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire  
Strongly to suffer and support our pains, </pre></div> </div>
