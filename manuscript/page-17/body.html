Thither let us tendFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,There rest, if any rest can harbour there,And reassembling our afflicted Powers,Consult how we may henceforth most offendOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,How overcome this dire Calamity,What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,If not what resolution from despare.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Thus Satan talking to his neerest MateWith Head up-lift above the wave, and EyesThat sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besidesProne on the Flood, extended</p></div> </div>
