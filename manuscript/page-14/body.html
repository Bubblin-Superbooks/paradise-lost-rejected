Breaking the horrid silence thus began.  

If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d  
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light  
Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine  
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,  
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,  
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,  
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd  
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest  
From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd  
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew  
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those  
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage  
Can else inflict do I repent or change,  
Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind  
And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit, </pre></div> </div>
