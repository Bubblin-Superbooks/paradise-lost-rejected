Thir Makers Image, answerd _Michael_, then  
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi’d  
To serve ungovern’d appetite, and took  
His Image whom they serv’d, a brutish vice,  
Inductive mainly to the sin of _Eve_.  
Therefore so abject is thir punishment,  
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,  
Or if his likeness, by themselves defac’t  
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules  
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they  
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.  

I yeild it just, said _Adam_, and submit.  
But is there yet no other way, besides  
These painful passages, how we may come  
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? </pre></div> </div>
