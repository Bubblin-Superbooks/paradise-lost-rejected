Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire  
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist  
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn  
Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold  
As from the Mine. Mean while at Table _Eve_  
Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups  
With pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence  
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,  
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin  
Enamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts  
Love unlibidinous reign’d, nor jealousie  
Was understood, the injur’d Lovers Hell.  

Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic’d,  
Not burd’nd Nature, sudden mind arose  
In _Adam_, not to let th’ occasion pass  
Given him by this great Conference to know </pre></div> </div>
