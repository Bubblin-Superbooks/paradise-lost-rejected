But from mee what can proceed,But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d,Not to do onely, but to will the sameWith me? how can they acquitted standIn sight of God? Him after all DisputesForc’t I absolve: all my evasions vainAnd reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me stillBut to my own conviction: first and lastOn mee, mee onely, as the sourse and springOf all corruption, all the blame lights due;So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou supportThat burden heavier then the Earth to bear,Then all the world much heavier, though dividedWith that bad Woman?
