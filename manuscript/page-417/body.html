Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix  
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?  

To whom the Angel with a smile that glow’d  
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,  
Answer’d. Let it suffice thee that thou know’st  
Us happie, and without Love no happiness.  
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy’st  
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy  
In eminence, and obstacle find none  
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:  
Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,  
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure  
Desiring; nor restrain’d conveyance need  
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.  
But I can now no more; the parting Sun  
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles </pre></div> </div>
