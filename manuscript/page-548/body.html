And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,  
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain’d  
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen  
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening  
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting  
Fool’d and beguil’d, by him thou, I by thee,  
To trust thee from my side, imagin’d wise,  
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,  
And understood not all was but a shew  
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib  
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,  
More to the part sinister from me drawn,  
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie  
To my just number found. O why did God,  
Creator wise, that peopl’d highest Heav’n  
With Spirits Masculine, create at last  
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect </pre></div> </div>
