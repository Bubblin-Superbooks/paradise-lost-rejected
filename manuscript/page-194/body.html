Mine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desire,  
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,  
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,  
With thee it came and goes: but follow me,  
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies  
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee  
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy  
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare  
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call’d  
Mother of human Race: what could I doe,  
But follow strait, invisibly thus led?  
Till I espi’d thee, fair indeed and tall,  
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,  
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,  
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,  
Thou following cryd’st aloud, Return fair _Eve_,  
Whom fli’st thou? whom thou fli’st, of him thou art, </pre></div> </div>
