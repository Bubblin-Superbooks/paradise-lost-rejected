By pollicy, and long process of time,  
In emulation opposite to Heav’n.  
Which when _Beelzebub_ perceiv’d, then whom,  
_Satan_ except, none higher sat, with grave  
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d  
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven  
Deliberation sat and publick care;  
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,  
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood  
With _Atlantean_ shoulders fit to bear  
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look  
Drew audience and attention still as Night  
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.  

Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n,  
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now  
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call’d </pre></div> </div>
