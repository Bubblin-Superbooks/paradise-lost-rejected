Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes  
That run through all the Heav’ns, or down to th’ Earth  
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,  
O’re Sea and Land: him _Satan_ thus accostes;  

_Uriel_, for thou of those seav’n Spirits that stand  
In sight of God’s high Throne, gloriously bright,  
The first art wont his great authentic will  
Interpreter through highest Heav’n to bring,  
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;

Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye  
To visit oft this new Creation round;  
Unspeakable desire to see, and know  
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,  
His chief delight and favour, him for whom </pre></div> </div>
