_Hesperean_ sets, my Signal to depart.  
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all  
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep  
His great command; take heed least Passion sway  
Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will  
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons  
The weal or woe in thee is plac’t; beware.  
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,  
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall  
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.  
Perfet within, no outward aid require;  
And all temptation to transgress repel.  

So saying, he arose; whom _Adam_ thus  
Follow’d with benediction. Since to part,  
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,  
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. </pre></div> </div>
