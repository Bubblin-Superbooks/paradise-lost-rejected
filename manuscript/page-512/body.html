Wide Anarchie of _Chaos_ damp and dark  
Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)  
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met  
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea  
Tost up and down, together crowded drove  
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.  
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse  
Upon the _Cronian_ Sea, together drive  
Mountains of Ice, that stop th’ imagin’d way  
Beyond _Petsora_ Eastward, to the rich  
_Cathaian_ Coast. The aggregated Soyle  
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,  
As with a Trident smote, and fix’t as firm  
As _Delos_ floating once; the rest his look  
Bound with _Gorgonian_ rigor not to move,  
And with _Asphaltic_ slime; broad as the Gate,  
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather’d beach </pre></div> </div>
