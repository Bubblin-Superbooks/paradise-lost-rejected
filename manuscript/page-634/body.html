How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,  
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav’n stand still  
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,  
Mans voice commanding, Sun in _Gibeon_ stand,  
And thou Moon in the vale of _Aialon_,  
Till _Israel_ overcome; so call the third  
From _Abraham_, Son of _Isaac_, and from him  
His whole descent, who thus shall _Canaan_ win.  

Here _Adam_ interpos’d. O sent from Heav’n,  
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things  
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne  
Just _Abraham_ and his Seed: now first I finde  
Mine eyes true op’ning, and my heart much eas’d,  
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom  
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see  
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, </pre></div> </div>
