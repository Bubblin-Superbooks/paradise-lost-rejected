Such night till this I never pass’d, have dream’d,  
If dream’d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,  
Works of day pass’t, or morrows next designe,  
But of offence and trouble, which my mind  
Knew never till this irksom night; methought  
Close at mine ear one call’d me forth to walk  
With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,  
Why sleepst thou _Eve_? now is the pleasant time,  
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields  
To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake  
Tunes sweetest his love-labor’d song; now reignes  
Full Orb’d the Moon, and with more pleasing light  
Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,  
If none regard; Heav’n wakes with all his eyes,  
Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,  
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment  
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. </pre></div> </div>
