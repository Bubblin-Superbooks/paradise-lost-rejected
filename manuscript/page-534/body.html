Sung _Halleluia_, as the sound of Seas,  
Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,

New Heav’n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,  
Or down from Heav’n descend. Such was thir song,  
While the Creator calling forth by name

As sorted best with present things. The Sun  
Had first his precept so to move, so shine,  
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat  
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call  
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring  
Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone </pre></div> </div>
