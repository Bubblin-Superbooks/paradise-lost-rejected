Blaz’d forth unclouded Deitie; he full  
Resplendent all his Father manifest  
Express’d, and thus divinely answer’d milde.  

Father Eternal, thine is to decree,  
Mine both in Heav’n and Earth to do thy will  
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov’d  
Mayst ever rest well pleas’d. I go to judge  
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,  
Whoever judg’d, the worst on mee must light,  
When time shall be, for so I undertook  
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine  
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom  
On me deriv’d, yet I shall temper so  
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most  
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.  
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none </pre></div> </div>
