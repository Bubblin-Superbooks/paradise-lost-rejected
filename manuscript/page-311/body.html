(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)  
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send  
Against us from about his Throne, and judg’d  
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,  
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,  
Of future we may deem him, though till now  
Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm’d,  
Some disadvantage we endur’d and paine,  
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,  
Since now we find this our Empyreal forme  
Incapable of mortal injurie  
Imperishable, and though peirc’d with wound,  
Soon closing, and by native vigour heal’d.  
Of evil then so small as easie think  
The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,  
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,  
May serve to better us, and worse our foes, </pre></div> </div>
