If rightly thou art call’d, whose Voice divine  
Following, above th’ _Olympian_ Hill I soare,  
Above the flight of _Pegasean_ wing.  
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou  
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top  
Of old _Olympus_ dwell’st, but Heav’nlie borne,  
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow’d,  
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,  
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play  
In presence of th’ Almightie Father, pleas’d  
With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee  
Into the Heav’n of Heav’ns I have presum’d,  
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,  
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down </pre></div> </div>
