Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine  
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,  
Living or dying from thee I will not hide  
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are risâ€™n,  
Tending to som relief of our extremes,  
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,  
As in our evils, and of easier choice.  
If care of our descent perplex us most,  
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd  
By Death at last, and miserable it is  
To be to others cause of misery,  
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring  
Into this cursed World a woful Race,  
That after wretched Life must be at last  
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power  
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent  
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. </pre></div> </div>
