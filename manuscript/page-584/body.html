_Adam_, thou know’st Heav’n his, and all the Earth  
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills  
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,  
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:  
All th’ Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,  
No despicable gift; surmise not then  
His presence to these narrow bounds confin’d  
Of Paradise or _Eden_: this had been  
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred  
All generations, and had hither come  
From all the ends of th’ Earth, to celebrate  
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.  
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down  
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:  
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine  
God is as here, and will be found alike  
Present, and of his presence many a signe </pre></div> </div>
