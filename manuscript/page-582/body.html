Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,  
Departure from this happy place, our sweet  
Recess, and onely consolation left  
Familiar to our eyes, all places else  
Inhospitable appeer and desolate,  
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer  
Incessant I could hope to change the will  
Of him who all things can, I would not cease  
To wearie him with my assiduous cries:  
But prayer against his absolute Decree  
No more availes then breath against the winde,  
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:  
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.  
This most afflicts me, that departing hence,  
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd  
His blessed count’nance; here I could frequent,  
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf’d </pre></div> </div>
