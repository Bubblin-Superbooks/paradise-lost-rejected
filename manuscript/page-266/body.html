Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop  
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.  

Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,  
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,  
Hear my Decree, which unrevok’t shall stand.  
This day I have begot whom I declare  
My onely Son, and on this holy Hill  
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold  
At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;  
And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow  
All knees in Heav’n, and shall confess him Lord:  
Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide  
United as one individual Soule  
For ever happie: him who disobeyes  
Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day  
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls </pre></div> </div>
