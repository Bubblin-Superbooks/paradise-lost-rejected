In what he gives to thee, this Paradise  
And thy faire _Eve_; Heav’n is for thee too high  
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:  
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;  
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there  
Live, in what state, condition or degree,  
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal’d  
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav’n.  

To whom thus _Adam_ cleerd of doubt, repli’d.  
How fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure  
Intelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,  
And freed from intricacies, taught to live,  
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts  
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which  
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,  
And not molest us, unless we our selves </pre></div> </div>
