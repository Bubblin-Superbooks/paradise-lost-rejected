What in an age they with incessant toyle  
And hands innumerable scarce perform  
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,  
That underneath had veins of liquid fire  
Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude  
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,  
Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:  
A third as soon had form’d within the ground  
A various mould, and from the boyling cells  
By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,  
As in an Organ from one blast of wind  
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.  
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge  
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound  
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,  
Built like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round  
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid </pre></div> </div>
