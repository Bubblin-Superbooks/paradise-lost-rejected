Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;  
But all that fair and good in thy Divine  
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav’nly Ray  
United I beheld; no Fair to thine  
Equivalent or second, which compel’d  
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come  
And gaze, and worship thee of right declar’d  
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.  

So talk’d the spirited sly Snake; and _Eve_  
Yet more amaz’d unwarie thus reply’d.  

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt  
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov’d:  
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?  
For many are the Trees of God that grow  
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown </pre></div> </div>
