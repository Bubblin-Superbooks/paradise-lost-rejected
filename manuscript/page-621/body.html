Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;  
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build  
A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav’n;  
And get themselves a name, least far disperst  
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,  
Regardless whether good or evil fame.  
But God who oft descends to visit men  
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks  
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,  
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower  
Obstruct Heav’n Towrs, and in derision sets  
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase  
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead  
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:  
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud  
Among the Builders; each to other calls  
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, </pre></div> </div>
