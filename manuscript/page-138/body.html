Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,  
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.  
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,  
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;  
And be thy self Man among men on Earth,  
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,  
By wondrous birth: Be thou in _Adams_ room  
The Head of all mankind, though _Adams_ Son.  
As in him perish all men, so in thee  
As from a second root shall be restor’d,  
As many as are restor’d, without thee none.  
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit  
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce  
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,  
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee  
Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,  
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg’d and die, </pre></div> </div>
