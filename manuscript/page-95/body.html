Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,  
_Satan_ with thoughts inflam’d of highest design,  
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell  
Explores his solitary flight; som times  
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,  
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares  
Up to the fiery concave touring high.  
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d  
Hangs in the Clouds, by _Aequinoctial_ Winds  
Close sailing from _Bengala_, or the Iles  
Of _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring  
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood  
Through the wide _Ethiopian_ to the Cape  
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem’d  
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer  
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, </pre></div> </div>
