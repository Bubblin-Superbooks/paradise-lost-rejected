Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men,  
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc’t,  
Created in his Image, there to dwell  
And worship him, and in reward to rule  
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,  
And multiply a Race of Worshippers  
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know  
Thir happiness, and persevere upright.  

So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,  
With _Halleluiahs_: Thus was Sabbath kept.  
And thy request think now fulfill’d, that ask’d  
How first this World and face of things began,  
And what before thy memorie was don  
From the beginning, that posteritie  
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst  
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say. </pre></div> </div>
