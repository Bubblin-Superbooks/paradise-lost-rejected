That Man may know he dwells not in his own;  
An Edifice too large for him to fill,  
Lodg’d in a small partition, and the rest  
Ordain’d for uses to his Lord best known.  
The swiftness of those Circles attribute,  
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,  
That to corporeal substances could adde  
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,  
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav’n  
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv’d  
In _Eden_, distance inexpressible  
By Numbers that have name. But this I urge,  
Admitting Motion in the Heav’ns, to shew  
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov’d;  
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem  
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.  
God to remove his wayes from human sense, </pre></div> </div>
