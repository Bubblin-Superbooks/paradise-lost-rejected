Had not th’ Eternal King Omnipotent  
From his strong hold of Heav’n high over-rul’d  
And limited thir might; though numberd such  
As each divided Legion might have seemd  
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand  
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd  
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert  
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway  
Of Battel, open when, and when to close  
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,  
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed  
That argu’d fear; each on himself reli’d,  
As onely in his arm the moment lay  
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame  
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred  
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground  
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing </pre></div> </div>
