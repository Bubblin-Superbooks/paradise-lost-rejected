Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,  
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun  
Declin’d was hasting now with prone carreer  
To th’ Ocean Iles, and in th’ ascending Scale  
Of Heav’n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:  
When _Satan_ still in gaze, as first he stood,  
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.  

O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,  
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc’t  
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,  
Not Spirits, yet to heav’nly Spirits bright  
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue  
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines  
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace  
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.  
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh </pre></div> </div>
