Through Heav’ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,  
Wak’t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand  
Unbarr’d the gates of Light. There is a Cave  
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,  
Where light and darkness in perpetual round  
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav’n  
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;  
Light issues forth, and at the other dore  
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre  
To veile the Heav’n, though darkness there might well  
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn  
Such as in highest Heav’n, arrayd in Gold </pre></div> </div>
