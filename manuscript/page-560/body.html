Or by collision of two bodies grinde  
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds  
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock  
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv’n down  
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,  
And sends a comfortable heat from farr,  
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,  
And what may else be remedie or cure  
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,  
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace  
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear  
To pass commodiously this life, sustain’d  
By him with many comforts, till we end  
In dust, our final rest and native home.  
What better can we do, then to the place  
Repairing where he judg’d us, prostrate fall </pre></div> </div>
