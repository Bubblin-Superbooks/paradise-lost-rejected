Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints  
By Thousands and by Millions rang’d for fight;  
Equal in number to that Godless crew  
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms  
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav’n  
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,  
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf  
Of _Tartarus_, which ready opens wide  
His fiery _Chaos_ to receave thir fall.  

So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began  
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl  
In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe  
Of wrauth awak’t: nor with less dread the loud  
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:  
At which command the Powers Militant,  
That stood for Heav’n, in mighty Quadrate joyn’d </pre></div> </div>
