Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,  
And longer will delay to heare thee tell

Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song

And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.  
This also thy request with caution askt  
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works  
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, </pre></div> </div>
