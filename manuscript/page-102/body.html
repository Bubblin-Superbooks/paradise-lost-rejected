What thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why  
In this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st  
Me Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son?  
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now  
Sight more detestable then him and thee.  

T’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;  
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem  
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair  
In Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight  
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin’d  
In bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,  
All on a sudden miserable pain  
Surpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm  
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast  
Threw forth, till on the left side op’ning wide,  
Likest to thee in shape and count’nance bright, </pre></div> </div>
