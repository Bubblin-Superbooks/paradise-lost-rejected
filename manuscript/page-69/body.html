Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,  
The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,  
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust  
That so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,  
If we were wise, against so great a foe  
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.  
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold  
And vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear  
What yet they know must follow, to endure  
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,  
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now  
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,  
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit  
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d  
Not mind us not offending, satisfi’d  
With what is punish’t; whence these raging fires  
Will slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames. </pre></div> </div>
