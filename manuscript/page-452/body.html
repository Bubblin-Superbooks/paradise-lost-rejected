His turret Crest, and sleek enamel’d Neck,  
Fawning, and lick’d the ground whereon she trod.  
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length  
The Eye of _Eve_ to mark his play; he glad  
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue  
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,

Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps  
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm  
Thy looks, the Heav’n of mildness, with disdain,  
Displeas’d that I approach thee thus, and gaze  
Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard  
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir’d.  
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,  
Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine  
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore </pre></div> </div>
