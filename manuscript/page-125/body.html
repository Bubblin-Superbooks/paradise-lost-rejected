Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t,  
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,  
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love  
In blissful solitude; he then survey’d  
Hell and the Gulf between, and _Satan_ there  
Coasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night  
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now  
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet  
On the bare outside of this World, that seem’d  
Firm land imbosom’d without Firmament,  
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.  
Him God beholding from his prospect high,  
Wherein past, present, future he beholds,  
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.  

Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage  
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds </pre></div> </div>
