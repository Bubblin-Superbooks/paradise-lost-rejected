Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,  
And tempt not these; but hast’n to appease  
Th’ incensed Father, and th’ incensed Son,  
While Pardon may be found in time besought.  

So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale  
None seconded, as out of season judg’d,  
Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic’d  
Th’ Apostat, and more haughty thus repli’d.  
That we were formd then saist thou? & the work  
Of secondarie hands, by task transferd  
From Father to his Son? strange point and new!  
Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw  
When this creation was? rememberst thou  
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?  
We know no time when we were not as now; </pre></div> </div>
