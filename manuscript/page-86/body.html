Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:  
Nor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d,  
That for the general safety he despis’d  
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d  
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast  
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,  
Or close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal.  
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark  
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:  
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds  
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread  
Heav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element  
Scowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;  
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet  
Extend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,  
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds  
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. </pre></div> </div>
