Of that alluring fruit, urg’d me so keene.  
About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,  
For high from ground the branches would require  
Thy utmost reach or _Adams_: Round the Tree  
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire  
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.

Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill

Strange alteration in me, to degree  
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech  
Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.  
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep  
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind  
Considerd all things visible in Heav’n, </pre></div> </div>
