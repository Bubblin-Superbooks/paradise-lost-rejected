As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav’n  
To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre  
Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise  
I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge  
They came, that like _Pomona’s_ Arbour smil’d  
With flourets deck’t and fragrant smells; but _Eve_  
Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair  
Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign’d  
Of three that in Mount _Ida_ naked strove,  
Stood to entertain her guest from Heav’n; no vaile  
Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme  
Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel _Haile_  
Bestowd, the holy salutation us’d  
Long after to blest _Marie_, second _Eve_.  

Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb  
Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons </pre></div> </div>
