We warr, if warr be best, or to regain  
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then  
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild  
To fickle Chance, and _Chaos_ judge the strife:  
The former vain to hope argues as vain  
The latter: for what place can be for us  
Within Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream  
We overpower? Suppose he should relent  
And publish Grace to all, on promise made  
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we  
Stand in his presence humble, and receive  
Strict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne  
With warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing  
Forc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits  
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes  
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,  
Our servile offerings. This must be our task </pre></div> </div>
