Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.  

To whom the sovran Presence thus repli’d.  
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey  
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,  
Superior, or but equal, that to her  
Thou did’st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place  
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,  
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell’d  
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd  
She was indeed, and lovely to attract  
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts  
Were such as under Government well seem’d,  
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part  
And person, had’st thou known thy self aright.  

So having said, he thus to _Eve_ in few: </pre></div> </div>
