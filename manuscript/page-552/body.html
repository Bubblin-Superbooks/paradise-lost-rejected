Commiseration; soon his heart relented  
Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,  
Now at his feet submissive in distress,  
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,  
His counsel whom she had displeas’d, his aide;  
As one disarm’d, his anger all he lost,  
And thus with peaceful words uprais’d her soon.  

Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,  
So now of what thou knowst not, who desir’st  
The punishment all on thy self; alas,  
Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine  
His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,  
And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers  
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place  
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,  
That on my head all might be visited, </pre></div> </div>
