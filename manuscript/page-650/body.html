But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde  
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild  
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,  
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth  
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard  
Infallible? yet many will presume:  
Whence heavie persecution shall arise  
On all who in the worship persevere  
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,  
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes  
Religion satisfiâ€™d; Truth shall retire  
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith  
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,  
To good malignant, to bad men benigne,  
Under her own waight groaning, till the day  
Appeer of respiration to the just,  
And vengeance to the wicked, at return </pre></div> </div>
