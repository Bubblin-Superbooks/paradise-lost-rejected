He ended, and they both descend the Hill;  
Descended, _Adam_ to the Bowre where _Eve_  
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak’t;  
And thus with words not sad she him receav’d.  

Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;  
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,  
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good  
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress  
VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;  
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,  
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,  
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee  
Art all things under Heav’n, all places thou,  
VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.  
This further consolation yet secure </pre></div> </div>
