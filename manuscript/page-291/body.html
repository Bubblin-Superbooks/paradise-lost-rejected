Of Battel now began, and rushing sound  
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.  
High in the midst exalted as a God  
Th’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate  
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos’d  
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;  
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now  
’Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,  
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front  
Presented stood in terrible array  
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,  
On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn’d,  
_Satan_ with vast and haughtie strides advanc’t,  
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;  
_Abdiel_ that sight endur’d not, where he stood  
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,  
And thus his own undaunted heart explores. </pre></div> </div>
