Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power  
Now rul’d him, punisht in the shape he sin’d,  
According to his doom: he would have spoke,  
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue  
To forked tongue, for now were all transform’d  
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories  
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din  
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now  
With complicated monsters, head and taile,  
Scorpion and Asp, and _Amphisbaena_ dire,  
_Cerastes_ hornd, _Hydrus_, and _Ellops_ drear,  
And _Dipsas_ (Not so thick swarm’d once the Soil  
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle  
_Ophiusa_) but still greatest hee the midst,  
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun  
Ingenderd in the _Pythian_ Vale on slime,  
Huge _Python_, and his Power no less he seem’d </pre></div> </div>
