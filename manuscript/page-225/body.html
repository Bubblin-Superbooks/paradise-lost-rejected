But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;  
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre  
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,  
Back to th’ infernal pit I drag thee chaind,  
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne  
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.  

So threatn’d hee, but _Satan_ to no threats  
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli’d.  

Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,  
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then  
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel  
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King  
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,  
Us’d to the yoak, draw’st his triumphant wheels  
In progress through the rode of Heav’n Star-pav’d. </pre></div> </div>
