I found not what me thought I wanted still;  
And to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.  

O by what Name, for thou above all these,  
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,  
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I  
Adore thee, Author of this Universe,  
And all this good to man, for whose well being  
So amply, and with hands so liberal  
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee  
I see not who partakes. In solitude  
What happiness, who can enjoy alone,  
Or all enjoying, what contentment find?  
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,  
As with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.  

What call’st thou solitude, is not the Earth </pre></div> </div>
