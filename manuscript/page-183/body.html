By _Nilus_ head, enclos’d with shining Rock,  
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote  
From this _Assyrian_ Garden, where the Fiend  
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind  
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:  
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,  
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad  
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,  
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine  
The image of thir glorious Maker shon,  
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,  
Severe, but in true filial freedom plac’t;  
Whence true autoritie in men; though both  
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;  
For contemplation hee and valour formd,  
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,  
Hee for God only, shee for God in him: </pre></div> </div>
