No ground of enmitie between us known,  
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.  
Was I to have never parted from thy side?  
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.  
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head  
Command me absolutely not to go,  
Going into such danger as thou saidst?  
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,  
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.  
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,  
Neither had I transgress’d, nor thou with mee.  

To whom then first incenst _Adam_ repli’d.  
Is this the Love, is the recompence  
Of mine to thee, ingrateful _Eve_, exprest  
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,  
Who might have liv’d and joyd immortal bliss, </pre></div> </div>
