Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire  
Of gesture or lest action overawd  
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav’d  
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:  
That space the Evil one abstracted stood  
From his own evil, and for the time remaind  
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm’d,  
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;  
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,  
Though in mid Heav’n, soon ended his delight,  
And tortures him now more, the more he sees  
Of pleasure not for him ordain’d: then soon  
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts  
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.  

Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet  
Compulsion thus transported to forget </pre></div> </div>
